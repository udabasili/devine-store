The new location currently has Chanel Classic Flap handbags available for $1,999 (regularly sold for anywhere from $1,795 to $2.495). Not a fan of Chanel? How about an LV or Burberry tote? I know, we couldn’t believe it ourselves. The deal seems too good to be true, we’re actually thinking of commissioning someone to grab us Chanel’s before they sell out! What do you think of luxury goods sold at the same venue where you can get your groceries? We say, luxury for less? We like. *Image courtesy of stylist.com .

A great travel bag to tote all your stuff in. If you, like us, carry magazines, an extra set of clothing, medicine, makeup, and food then this bag is just perfect.

Selena Gomez wore them on the today show and I fell in love, I know they aren’t Loubs b/c the sole isnt red, so can you please help me find out what they are? thanks so much!” Well my general rule of thumb is that if they look similar to Louboutins and aren’t Louboutins then they’re probably Brian Atwoods. The only problem is that this style by Brian Atwood is completely sold out online! However, being the amazing Chics that we are, we found you three alternative pairs that are just as hot if not hotter (not to mention a lot cheaper) than the original. Hope this helps! 1. Samanta Women’s Viv Sling 2. Jinny Kim Silver Glitter Lydia Pump in Skin Beige 3. Aldo Atlantic City Pump *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links.

Honestly I’m quite annoyed that the producers ( writers? ), whoever keep us on our last nerves with their un-sequential airing dates; but am easily calmed by the episodes’ wardrobe choices. Take the latest style savior, Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and her white and black lace top. The moment my eyes met the designer masterpiece, I automatically recognized the top that I’ve been eying for quite some time online, only to never find my size in stock ( damn you fashionistas and your perfect style taste! ). The blouse is by Nanette Lepore, and it’s called the Cream Tie Top. As I said, it’s sold out online (it’s last season), but you can try searching for it on the sale racks in stores. Happy trying to find it Shopping! *Images courtesy of cwtv.com and my-wardrobe.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

There’s a bit of controversy surrounding the cover pic where critics are saying the photo was overly photoshopped and does not reflect her current weight. Self Magazine is fighting back saying they treated the photo with the usual retouching they provide for every star.” Now let’s discuss. I wouldn’t call this a ‘scandal’ like everyone else, more like a disappointment. I’m appalled that a magazine entitled SELF would literally erase parts of a person’s body in order to make her to look ‘better’ in their eyes and, in return, sell more issues. I would actually feel more compelled to buy the magazine, seeing Kelly in her actual figure since it resembles a confident woman. Listen, we feel like everyone is ignoring what matters here. The girl is healthy. She is not morbidly obese. She is a talented, empowering female who loves her curves. Self magazine, we’re disappointed.

But the bad thing is that she wore it a lot around 2 years ago, and doesn’t wear it anymore. I’ve tried to find it on my own a few times on the internet, but had no luck. I even tried to find some other thunderbolt necklaces similar to it, but they never satisfied my taste. So when I recently found your site, I knew I had to ask you, and so I hope this won’t be much of a challenge for you! Thank you!!!” Oh what a cute necklace! But since Ashley wore the it a while back, it was hard to ID. It could be from an unknown vendor, like most unrecognizable celeb items, or it could just have been discontinued/sold out. But we managed to find an eerily similar necklace by Dogeared ! The lightning bolt is as tiny (.5 inches long) and dipped in gold. The price tag is perfect for anyone struggling in the recession, $30! Happy shopping! *Images courtes of misstisdale.net and dogeared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I am loving the beaded necklace with the gold accents and the gold plated bracelet. The other pieces are not really my style since I dislike costume jewelry that looks like real jewelry… I’m sure there will be plenty more of amazing pieces to choose from tomorrow so mark your calenders and make sure to come back here and tell us what you scored *Images courtesy of instyle.com .

I came across this photo of Alessandra at Coachella and I’m in love with her boots! Do you know who’s they are, or some similar boots at a reasonable price? Thanks so much!” So that fact that it took us all of 2 seconds to recognize her boots can either mean A ) We’re just that good or B ) We do too much online browsing/shopping which isn’t good for our health. We’ll choose to go with option A and get on with it…Her boots are by Frye ( the pull-on tabs were a huge giveaway ), and they’re called the Carson Pull On Boot . They come in so many colors, and retail for $347. If you’re not willing to dig that deep into your wallet, then why not try these Franco Sarto boots for $106? Or you can get an even cheaper version with these delia*s boots. Finally how about donning western boots from a designer that hails from The South herself, Jessica Simpson. We’re guessing they’d do the job just fine. Happy Shopping! *Images courtesy of their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

The leather is quite soft and slightly distressed and color is a deeper tan than pictured. They are a pull-on style without any zipper so they fit slim up through calf with a very slight slouchy look.

Since the dress code is pink, I don’t know how to look chic in that color. Please help me with an outfit idea, thanks!” We here at Chic Intuition have a theory about clothing: you can pull off any color, as long as the cut is right. So, though you might think that pink is too girly, we politely choose to disagree. Check out the perfectly pink dress options we found for you above, with stars rocking the color as well. We guarantee that with the right accessories ( nude shoes are a big IN this season ), you’ll be the belle of the ball. Happy Shopping!

The pairing of this loose flowing jacket with slim legged pants or denim is so elegant, we can’t wait to try it out ourselves. Once we spotted this image of Diane Kruger, we rushed to find a more affordable version by L.A.M.B. . Wear it with black skinnies and booties for a night out. Only accessory needed?

Any recommendations? Thanks!” Well that’s what the internetz are for Steph! It’s hands down one of the greatest venues where manufacturers can sell their products, and the best part is that a lot of products are moderately priced. One such website is Amazon , and we found an almost identical knuckle ring here for much less than the original.

One bow per outfit is more than enough to make a statement. Anyways, I decided to go on the lookout for some bow embellished tops and feel the urge to share my findings. Here are my faves: 1.

We’re thinking it’s the awful economy, but we’d like to believe that designers are just treating us to some fashion fun. One of our personal faves, who’s perfected the cozy chic look is Norma Kamali. I remember spotting her clothing for the first time 3 years ago, and found myself falling in love with almost every sweater I laid my eyes on. Her pieces are the perfect ‘wear and go’ items (think classic sportswear with a twist), and we’re so excited that she’s decided to pair up with Walmart for some affordable alternatives. Her most coveted piece, the batwing cardigan, which normally retails for $265, is available for $18! Check out her collaboration now! *Images courtesy of walmart.com.

In addition to the hilarious plot, I have to admit that I really tune in to watch what the main character Joan, played by Tracee, will be wearing. I can honestly admit that she’s helped me form my personal style sense. Her casual-quirky style vibe is just divine, and I feel like Tracee’s personal style has an impact on what her character chooses to wear. Honestly I was wondering what graphics to focus on, Tracee’s looks or Joan’s. So this is going to be a two part post. Today we’re going to dedicate the article to Tracee’s personal style. Work. It. *Images courtesy of bossip.com, obsessed-hoopla.blogspot.com, and habitualbeauty.net and nigerianwomaninnorway.blogspot.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Okay maybe I’m exaggerating a bit, but you get the point. \nThe webisodes follow an aspiring fashion designer, Bianca turner (played by Femi Emiola, Wicked Wicked Games), who is a prime example of a woman who’s got it going on. I’m talking the dream job, the man who’s got all the ladies drooling, and the spice to keep it all together. Think James Bond meets Sanaa Latham in “Something New”, Bianca is the girl who isn’t afraid to run in her Louboutin Heels!\nLink: http://www.iflookscouldkill.com\nThe last episode-The Sell Out- has been available since 7/21, but it’s not too late to catch up and tune in. I work with Toyota, so take my word for it. I’m sure that you’ll be reeled in, so don’t be surprised when you are. Also, don’t forget to hit me up with the scoop on your thoughts, or comments from others, about the webisodes. \nLooking forward to the chit chat!\nBest,\nAmanda Clouden\nILCK Ambassador\nAmanda.Clouden@yahoo.com"

Let’s just say I’m not questioning them anymore… I am officially IN LOVE with Boyfriend Jeans! How you may ask? Well it’s an interesting story. Yesterday I spent the day cleaning up my bedroom which was suffering from a major case of clothing explosion generated by me and my husband’s inability to take two steps towards our closet and hang up our clothes! So I happened to stumble upon a pair of my hubby’s jeans during this process and something possessed me to try them on. Well I did, then added a stretchy belt with a buckle made of two snakes intertwined, tucked in a white tank, threw on a deep purple coccoon cardi, and slipped into some heels. The effect was amazing and the pants were soooooooo comfy (skinny jeans are so binding in comparison)! The only problem though was that his jeans were a bit too big so I decided that I needed a pair of my own and preferably made for women since men’s pants look too drop crotch for my own comfort. It looks like I’m getting the same Current Elliot pair that I so unsurely blogged about two months ago which I find pretty ironic. What about you guys, have you changed your minds about BF jeans? *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I don’t know if you guys may have already noticed, but I L.O.V.E bling! In my opinion, one should invest, invest, invest when it comes to jewelry because it always takes your look a notch or two higher. My piece of choice? Why the statement ring of course! Something about a big stone or thick stack on my hands makes me feel instantly stylish. On a day like any other, as I did my daily online window shopping, I happened to stumble upon the jewelry section at Shopbop and let me say they’ve gone all out! The pieces are spectacular and I am really digging their rings. Check out my fave picks under $100.

                            "post_text_content": "December 15, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview She’s taken black from basic to bold , and it’s no wonder that females are flocking to their laptops for fashionable inspiration. Hailing from sunny O.C., California, Jaime has found fast fame amongst the blogosphere, which we can’t help by crediting her beautiful face and heavenly closet snaps. It’s all in the colors people (in her case one specific choice), and this 20 year old sure knows how to wear it. Check out what she had to say and then prance on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: When we say that we are ‘hooked’ to your blog, that’s a mere understatement. We can’t pinpoint the actual reason why, but think it’s your allure and mysterious demeanor through photography and writing that keep us coming back. Do you subconsciously post in a particular style, or was the concept of your blog thought out beforehand? Jaime: Definitely subconsciously! All the pictures and clothes I wear that day depend on how I am feeling that certain day. Sometimes it’s “moody” and other times it’s just fun and lively! The “concept” of my blog was definitely not thought out beforehand. As a matter of fact, I was going to delete it after the first day because I was very hesitant about it. But I’m so glad I didn’t, after all the interest and love I have been receiving from all the sweet and lovely bloggers (like Chic Intuition!) I have encountered! Chic Intuition : Ok, so we know you’re addicted to coffee. So spill (not literally!), how many cups a day? Jaime: Only one cup a day, actually! If it’s black coffee, then I’ll have one venti sized, and if it’s a latte or Americano, then one grande sized with triple shots of espresso. That’s nothing compared to my sister who drinks three venti sized cups of coffee a day! However, today I had coffee overload with two large mugs of black coffee and a grande soy latte! I’m really antsy and energized as I’m typing this. Chic Intuition: So Jaime Wears Black, but does she wear any other colors? Jaime: Besides black, I wear gray and a little bit of white. Other than that, I think I own like four clothes that are brown, navy blue, and green. I think that’s about the only color I have in my closet. Oh and I have a confession, I wear pink and Hello Kitty pajamas to sleep! Chic Intuition: Thank you for introducing us to your personal style icon, Jang Yoon Ju . She’s one of our new faves. What do you love about her? Jaime: I love that her style and clothes are very simple, yet chic and classy! I think her style epitomizes minimalism and she shows us that less is more! Other than that, I think she has this charm and attraction to her face and personality. Oh, and I absolutely love her smile and the way she smiles with her eyes. Chic Intuition: Annoying scenario: you’re given $1000 to spend….at [enter your least fave/most boring shop name here] what do you do? Jaime : Hollister and/or Abercrombie. Oh goodness, this is torture because they don’t have ANY black clothes. I’ll probably just buy tons of their pajamas for my sisters and me! Chic Intuition: Your closet is heavenly. Any advice on how to achieve our ‘dream closet’? Jaime : Decorate your closet with any pictures or even words that are inspiring and encouraging to you! It could be pages from a magazine or even pictures of yourself, family, and friends. I started decorating my closet with my personal favorite pages from magazines to always remind myself to be inspired and creative in terms of clothes and style! It encourages me to always be stylish and to never get lazy when dressing up. Also, try to organize your clothes by type, like t-shirts on one section, dresses in another section, etc. so that it’ll be easier for you to mix and match your whole outfit together. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical q time: How much black is too much? Jaime: You can never have too much black! *Images courtesy of jaimewearsblack.blogspot.com .

The bracelet/timepiece duo gives off an edgy vibe when paired with the right outfit, or can work in a more elegant scenario when partnered with a delicate top and skirt. One of our latest affordable discoveries is the La Mer Collections at shopbop.com . They have so many different takes on the wrap watch, and we took the liberty of selecting a few faves. Best part, they’re all around or under the $100 mark!

It seems like the next sentence that comes out of my friends’ mouths while shopping is always “Wow! That would look great with a pair of leggings!” We’ve all been wondering in the back of our minds if they’ve extended their stay. I, personally, say no and declare leggings to be a lifetime staple like jeans. I am even more confident saying that now that I’ve seen these gorgeous embellished Bebaroque Tights . They are basically jewelry for your legs and will really take ur outfit in a whole new direction. Are u confident enough to try them??? I know I am!",

This is a good example of how an ill fitting dress can go from, well a dress, to a nightie. On the other hand, just a few days before she was rocking the same designer in a much more flattering outfit. What a difference! Oh, and Eric Bana, we just kept his pics here for well, eye candy.

We did a LOT of posts on gladiators, so here are the links\nhttp://www.chicintuition.com/?p=1135\nhttp://www.chicintuition.com/?p=1602\nhttp://www.chicintuition.com/?p=1436\n3. To be honest, its hard to recommend jeans to someone whose body type we aren’t familiar with.  But brand-wise, J Brand, Joe’s Jeans and Cheap Monday are our top picks.\n4. Sorry, we didn’t get a chance to see the limited edition bag.  But to be honest, we’d rather invest in an Hermes Birkin or Jumbo Quilted Chanel (classics) than a Prada.\n5. Again, we aren’t familiar with your face shape so we can’t recommend a specific type.  But currently Ray Ban Wayferes, Tom Ford anything, and Stella McCartney are our faves."

Can you ID the bag that Jenny Humprey is carrying in the picture below? It looks so fierce, and I have to know where it’s from! “ Natalie, as a matter of fact we do! The gorgeous bag Jenny is donning is by the great Be & D (otherwise known as the pioneers of the studded bag). It is the Be & D Studded Convertible Shoulder Tote and it is fabulous. Unfortunately it looks like the black and gold version Jenny is wearing is sold out but the nickel and black is just as hot in our opinion… Happy shopping! *Image courtesy of gossipgirlinsider.com .

Well simply because they’re the easiest item to accessories in anyone’s closet. You can wear a white tee with stylish harem pants and you’re ready to go, or you can place it under a blazer for an office chic look. There are so many different ways to wear tees, and the best part about them is they’re A)cheap and B)summer friendly. Don’t even get us started on embellished tees. We love them like any girl, and Sass & Bide have done a fine job with fulfilling our every dream here. Just take a look for yourself.

It’s the quirky comments, lovely video posts, and constant updates of model searches vs college term papers that make her blog so interesting and addictive. Twenty-two year old Laurel from It’s Her Factory isn’t your normal chick from Nevada, as you can probably tell by now, and that’s why we just had to interview her. Read on… Chic Intuition: Let’s get the obvious question out of the way first. You’re an aspiring model, currently finishing her college degree. What got you hooked on to the fashion world? Laurel: Well, I see the fashion as just another way of self expression – as cliché as that sounds. The industry, (along with trend and design) is constantly changing. I like the idea of being part of that, in some small way and contributing your daily style to the larger world of fashion! Chic Intuition: Is your aspiration for a career in fashion what fueled the start of a blog? Laurel: Not really, I was interested in what all of these bloggers are doing to show the world what their idea of fashion is, what inspires them and keeps them going. Starting It’s Her Factory has actually opened up my eyes to everything from modeling (crosses fingers!) to even the idea of a career in writing or technology. I think a blog can really help a person to figure out their interests and just learn more from each other. Chic Intuition: Ok scenario: you have an unlimited budget to purchase just ONE accessory. What would it be and why? Laurel: Oh dear god, I would freak if I was really given this question. So hard to decide! I would probably go with an Yves Saint Laurent Downtown Tote in black leather. Simple and timeless. Or maybe a Givenchy? Gah! My head hurts, next! Chic Intuition: How would you define your style? Is it constant or do you rotate with the trends of the season? Laurel: It tends to remain pretty constant, but when fall comes around I do get more into ‘chunky’ mode – boots, knits, coats & scarves. My wardrobe also gets a bit darker with the seasons’ turn, I love shades over color for fall/winter. Chic Intuition: Which designer are you currently digging? Laurel: Adoring designs coming out of Denmark like Ivan Grundhal, and Bruuns Bazaar. I’ve got a thing for ‘darker’ designing like Rad Hourani and Martin Margiela, too. Such great textures and structure you don’t get to see everyday. Chic Intuition: Agyness Deyn: overrated or underappreciated? Laurel: Overrated by a longshot. I think she is a phenomenal model, but she has been in the mainstream spotlight for WAY too long now. Chic Intuition: Philosophical question time: How long is too long? Laurel: Calf-length and Aggy’s career. *Images courtesy of itslasfactory.blogspot.com and cmiper.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Do I hate it? Hmmm not really. It’s hard to dislike anything with clothing that beautiful in the picture. Check out the chain detailed top in the middle especially- WOWZA! Anyways back on track, would you wear this look??? I can only imagine the amount of ridicule you’d get from you’re not too fashion conscious friends (everyone has at least one of those) but if you’re willing to take the risk… To get the look: 1. Straighten hair with a flatiron and apply a gloss serum. 2. Bring all hair to the front and form a ponytail similar to a uniqorn’s horn. 3. Split this ponytail into two halves and twist each half into a bun, pin, and you’re done. Make sure and try to form an S-shape with the two buns. *Images courtesy of style.com .

                            "post_text_content": "April 14, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview Who could resist not clicking through a site with a name so scrumptious? The moment we started reading Emily’s blog, we knew we were hooked. Cupcakes and Cashmere ( sigh ) is like reading the cool/stylish girl’s diary, only better. This 25 year old Los Angeles native works as an online account manager by day, and runs one of the most awesome fashion blogs by night. Take a look at what this chic stylista had to say and then head on over to her world . Chic Intuition: If you HAD to choose, what would you prefer, cupcakes or cashmere? Emily: If I had to choose between cupcakes or cashmere, I’d go with the cashmere (though a red velvet cupcake from La Provence bakery in Beverly Hills is quite a close second), especially in the form of lounge clothes. When I was in college (and very short on cash), my mom surprised me with a pair of Juicy Couture cashmere pants and they were an absolutely dream to slip into. Unfortunately, I wore them to the point where they had a massive hole in the crotch and I simply had to toss them. Chic Intuition: We noticed that you have a number of handmade jewelry that you make yourself, and we love the fact that they’re made with unexpected materials. Where do you find the time and talent for your chic creations? Emily: Thank you! I’ve always loved jewelry and I think working with slightly unexpected fabrics and stones make for the most interesting pieces. I’m about to open up my Etsy shop where I’ll be selling things like tulle and druzy agate necklaces and I think they’re really different than what you would find in just your normal boutique. It’s a great creative outlet for me as well so when I’m watching a movie it’s nice to simultaneously be productive. Chic Intuition: We know how unhealthy (on the wallet) shopping can sometimes be. But if there were a battle between internet shopping and actual store hopping, who would win in your case and why? Emily: There’s nothing better than strolling through a boutique, thumbing through clothes and spotting a piece that was made for you. Over the years though, I’ve become quite the pro at not only finding great things online, but tracking down the best price as well. With sites like Gilt Groupe , ShopItToMe and ShopStyle , it’s easy to find exactly what you want at a price that doesn’t hurt your wallet too much. Chic Intuition: So OMG moment while reading your blog: you were on an episode of THE HILLS?! Spill.details.ASAP. Emily: Ha yes, I was actually on several episodes of The Hills when I worked at Teen Vogue. I landed a job as a sales assistant with the magazine right after I graduated from college and a few months later, the MTV camera crew pretty much took over the office. The girls (L.C. and Whitney) were always sweet and it was just a fun experience watching the ways in which it was filmed and then getting to see myself on T.V. Chic Intuition: Name 3 Spring trends you’re just craving to try. Emily: For spring, I want to try and mix patterns within an outfit. I’ve always been a bit skeptical about pairing stripes with florals, but I certainly applaud those who can pull it off. I’m pretty boring when it comes to my hair styles, but I’m also anxious to try out things like multiple braids and hippie-inspired headwear. The last thing I love for spring is neon. Essie has a new nail polish collection coming out with pinks that you just want to eat right up. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how sweet is too sweet? Emily: Sweet things should always be balanced out properly. Whether that’s a light pink dress or a cupcake, you never want to go over the top. So as long as you’ve got a spiky belt or a cup of icy milk, you’ll never cross that line. *Images courtesy of cupcakesandcashmere.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I don’t know what it is but I just love huge statement rings! I actually have begun to wear three at a time a la Olsen style for an edgier look and am completely satisfied with the results. My husband also jokes that I can use them for self defense! So while in search for some new fashion conquests, I happened to stumble upon some amazing rings. Since I can’t buy all of them, I decided to be generous and share my finds with you. Enjoy! 1. Elizabeth and James Snake Ring 2. Roberto Cavalli Turquoise Cocktail Ring 3. Anna Beck Set of Stackable Rings 4. Juicy Couture R-Cameo Ring in Black 5. Femme Metale Jewelry Rectangle Ring in Silver",

Using the smokin’ eyes kit , brush pink highlight shadow all over your eyelids. Next, using the pewter base shadow, apply color from upper lashline to browbone and along the lower lashline. Using the charcoal shadow, start at the outer corner of your lid and blend halfway inwards then out. Take the smokin’ liner and line upper lashes from the outer corner in and lower lashes from the outer corner to three quarters of the way in. Trace over liner, with the charcoal shadow. Apply eye bright to the inner corner of your eye and right below the brow. Lastly, use brow zings wax to define brow. 3. Generously brush BADgal lash black mascara onto upper and lower lashes. 4.

Remember the hype with the saddle-bag in ’00? I remember purchasing mine at the Dior boutique in Paris, and the store was packed with fashionistas trying to snag one!! Well, that memory seems to have faded away into my mental file cabinet with label “ past trends ” stamped on. I’ve been quietly rooting for the label to come out with an “it” bag for a while now, but seems like MJ, YSL, and Miu Miu keep coming out with hits. And don’t even try mentioning the ever-lasting Chanel classics. Dior, I’m taking this moment to make a public plea: redeem yourself! We loved you then, and we’ll love you now (if you just take the time to make something we would want to spend major mula on, and wear on a daily basis). *Images courtesy of echicas.net .

So much so that I actually had a lot of trouble picking out my favourite looks! I think the ones below, though, are a perfect representation of a collection that boasts of silky fabrics, pretty pastels, and major fabric detailing. The collection has draping, ruching, pleating, and even some type of new weaving technique that I’ve never even seen before! As always expected of Burberry Prorsum, this simple play with fabrics really turned a maybe basic collection into a smashing and dramatic affair! Bravo! *Images courtesy of style.com .

Take for example, Leighton Meester. She’s a perfect beauty, right? Well look at how different she looks on the left with the raccoon eyes and dark lips combo. Her features even managed to change. But with a more natural look, she is a beauty like no other. So lesson of the day Chiceristas, less is more. Actually less is much much more! *Images courtesy of prphotos.com .

When visiting StyleQ you literally have the chance to be styled merely by purchasing the pieces they have for sale. Why? Because those pieces are personally selected and styled to perfection by a different well-known stylist every few months and they started with Monica Rose (one of our faves). Her choices bring you every little bit closer to achieving the looks of Catt Sadler and the Kardashian sisters with a plethora of amazing blazers, gorgeous blouses, and statement jewelry galore. We spoke to the big people behind StyleQ telling them how much we think our readers would love their vision and the pieces they have for sale and they gave us an amazing discount exclusive to Chic Intuition. Use code CHIC60 to get 60% off the entire site plus free shipping! I think I’m gonna head over there right now to beat the online crowds! Oh and be on the lookout November 4, 2009 when StyleQ completely re-launches with a new assortment, profiling Eva Longoria, Scarlett Johannson, Rihanna, and featuring two hugely popular fashion-inspired TV shows that they can’t mention yet. The only hint they could give was that one of them involves a sexy housewife who lives in a big city. Got any guesses?",

Unfortunately the same one is from the past season and so it’s sold out but we found a similar and cheaper version with this Alexander Wang Faded Denim Jacket with Leather Sleeves .

Two weeks ago we recieved an email from Gilt Groupe informing us of some awesome news. Do you want to save even more on their already slashed off prices? Well, now you can with their latest project: Gilt Fuse. Just like Gilt, there’ll be a whole new lineup of fashion, just for women. And here’s the difference: the prices will be much lower and will feature a wider range of styles to mix and match. Only members of Gilt Groupe will be able to check it out before the fall. First sales start August 12! If you’re not already a member, click here for an exclusive invite . *Image courtesy of giltgroupe.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Take a look at the celebs that are donning it for the red carpet, even though it can be worn casually as well. How? Just part your hair in the middle and divide into 2 sections. Loosely braid each part and secure with a thin elastic band that matches the color of your hair. Take each braid, and pin it to the top of your head.

Though we weren’t big fans of Bar Rafaeli hosting, the segment that stuck in our heads was mystical designer Erin Fetherston’s dinner party. MTV featured Erin hosting an intimate dinner party for 8 at her Tribeca apartment in celebration of her Fall 2009 Collection for her friends and muses who helped inspire the collection. Guests included Chanel Iman, photographer Ellen von Unwerth, Sarah Sophie Flicker, Kate Schelter and model Ingrid Sophie Schram. All of the guests had a specific dresscode, Erin’s Fall Collection of course! In addition, we loved the setting, quirky mask headbands, and Erin’s apartment. Take a look at some lovely snapshots of the event, maybe you’ll be inspired to host a fairytale soiree with friends! *Images courtesy of bpcm.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

We literally have to hold ourselves back from re-creating her outfit posts on a daily basis. But honestly, we couldn’t help ourselves here, her look was so easy to let pass by. You can get her awesome Alexander Wang bag here , a similar sheer blouse , cropped jeans shorts , and oxford flats here . Also, we can almost swear that she’s wearing this multi-chain bracelet by Giles & Brother. Happy Shopping! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and shopbop.com .

These Three Floor Finder’s Keepers Trousers instantly caught my attention when doing my usual internet window shopping that always turns into actual shopping… The look is definitely trendy in a less risky sort of way and the price tag is pretty darn reasonable.

Every time we see one of the Olsen’s dashing around and making more millions, they are always balancing 3+ items in one hand. Mind you, one of the items almost always consists of a Starbucks iced latte, but that’s besides the point. Actually, no it isn’t. In fact, it proves my point even more valid. Have you ever seen an Olsen drop her divine ‘bucks??? I haven’t. In fact I credit the girls for making this coffee chain a pop culture obsession. Now, time for my ponderings: do the twins have special powers that not only allow them to magically juggle numerous items in one hand, but also look extremely stylish while doing it??

Well we did some research and were able to figure it out. Of course our friends at Singer 22 ended up having it as they are always ‘in the know’ about the latest celebrity pieces. Anyways, it’s the Jamison Rollins Stripe Wrap Hooded Sweater in Pepper for those of you who’ve been wondering. Lastly, to make things clear, we never said we hated Jenny’s new style (we actually also L.O.V.E her sweater) but were just wondering what happens in the upcoming episodes to make her go from oh so prep to so grunge. Guess we’ll all just have to wait and see… *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links. Graphic courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

After a bit of research, I was happily surprised to find that InStyle.com did a full breakdown on bang types by face shape.

But after spotting these freakishly fun earrings, and seeing the bracelet in action, we have to admit that they’re kinda hot; will surely garner an interesting convo in any situation.

Never mind ). At first we thought we’d be tuning into the Rachel Zoe Project to avidly take notes on the stylist’s fashion, only to find ourselves in a trance over her styling associate’s outfits. Last week, by the way fab episode, we couldn’t help but wonder what bag she was carrying. A Birkin? Mullberry? No ladies, it’s a classic Chanel tote, and it’s just divine. We never would have picked this bag to be a winner (at least not for someone over the age of 65), but after witnessing it in action on the show, well… the bag deserves its own credit at the end of the episode! Very chic alternative to the 2 year wait-listed Hermes. *Images courtesy of chanel.com and bravotv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Mobile phones have always stood as a fashion accessory since the days of Carrie and her pink flip phone, so it’s no surprise that girls love to add a little oomph to their phones with colorful covers. Most of the time, some covers tend to be too bright or blingy, but these indie inspired iPhone covers are just right. Designed by DANNIJO ( one of our fave jewelry designers ) for Uncommon, this print iPhone cover protects your iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS with reinforced impact zones and shatterproof polycarbonate. Dockable capsule design, black screen bezel, and easy-access button covers. *Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Something about the color and the style looked so regal on her and oh so couture! Frankly, I thought I wouldn’t be able to find it at all because I instantly assumed it was straight off the runways. Well, lo and behold, I ended up finding it and it was actually not bad price-wise. If you’re also interested to know, she’s wearing a D&G Dolce & Gabbana Ruffle Blouse Grosgrain Ribbon Back Tie in Blush .

The lucky fashionista to get her hands on it before everyone else? Why, MK Olsen of course. We remember the day the emails came swarming in inquiring about the ‘ hot bottom studded bag ‘ or the ‘ cool pebbled leather duffel ‘. The mission to ID it was quite impossible at first, since she donned it before it even made its runway appearance. After that, frenzy ensued. So it’s no surprise that the people over at Alexander Wang emailed us today about a new version of the bag called the Rocco Mini Duffel bag with 4 colors/fabric options. Surprise! If you’re interested, you better hurry. The gray leather already sold out. Wangsteristas are rough! *Images courtesy of alexanderwang.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

On one hand, it’s a beautiful vintage Lacroix and I love the unusual mixing of red, green, and blue together. On the other hand, though, I can’t help but feel that something about it looks off and a little costumey. Could it be that she styled the dress all wrong with her ballet style bun (can’t help but be reminded of The Nutcracker) and strappy sandals? I guess they were both too formal and sleek with that kind of dress… It’s funny how Katie has an amazing clothing budget, body, and face and yet her outfits always tend to bomb over the tiniest of details. What do you guys think? Hot or soooooooooo Not? *Images courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

In terms of footwear, there was the fringe boot, the studded sandal, the nero gladiator, and now the zipped ankle boot. I personally think it’s hot but not as original as the others… What do you think??? Buy them here .",

Well, like they say, imitation is the best form of flattery right? We’re guessing that after the success of the former mentioned, F + C decided to come out with a much smaller, messenger version called the Disco City Bag . And guess what, we’re in love! Why haven’t they thought of it any sooner? The size is just perfect for your wallet, sunnies, and mobile, and the messenger strap adds a whole other comfort factor to the bag.

The stylish designer coordinated her turquoise dress and white Elizabeth and James blazer with a pair of black suede wedge heels from the new shoe line due out this spring. Mary-Kate’s pair are actually a prototype directly from the factory and is the line’s take on an ankle bootie. What do you think of it? *Image courtesy of people.com .

It started with Cassie, then Carmen Electra, then Rihanna, and now Solange Knowles. I personally, think Solange took it a little too far. Especially since, unlike the others, her style is not necessarily super-edgy but more trendy and divalicious. I think it’s mostly the shock factor that encourages these girls to go for that extra buzz. What do you think? Would you do it??? *Images courtesy of people.com .

She is the woman that made us fall in love with the boyfriend blazer all over again and the one who managed to convince us that synthetic leather is just as good as the real thing. Well her Spring 2010 line is no exception! The pieces are extremely wearable and present the perfect mix of masculine and feminine details. I’m especially digging the lace accents and the striking cobalt color and who could have imagined that the denim skirt could actually look cool?

One of them is layering a strapless dress over a long sleeve top and we call it the ultimate recessionista fix. What better way to make use of your spring dresses than by transitioning them into fall pieces with a long sleeve top and some dark hued tights? Now you don’t have to feel guilty splurging a little on that perfect dress. Don’t you love how we help make your shopping guilt-free? *Images courtesy of style.com .

She seems to be quite the fan of loafers, and these otherwise granny style shoes are starting to grow on me as well. Just make sure to follow Ashley’s lead and wear them with ankle length skinnies to avoid looking 40 years older. I went on a wild goose chase, and found a much cheaper alternative to her’s, these FRYE flats for $158. Happy Shopping! *Images courtesy of olsensanonymous.blogspot.com and endless.com .

Of course as soon as I got home I rushed online, where I knew my shopping time wouldn’t be limited, and perused the entire line.

I’ve been keeping a close eye on Ms Project Runway and have to admit, her street style disappoints.

Now don’t go hating on us, and we know a lot of you will argue that she’s also a full time mom in addition to her other 38,495 jobs, but she seems to take her 4 year old daughters fashion advice when it comes to matching her outfit pieces.

Something about the black color combined with the geometric shapes makes this the perfect statement necklace in my book. The funny thing is that I thought it must be by some hotshot designer and was surprised to discover that it’s actually from Nicole’s House of Harlow line! After a long time waiting, it’s finally available for pre-order here . Also, make sure to check out the other newly available pieces such as the superhot double strand gold headband.

Can I hear you tall chic-eristas clapping?! Well I’m with you guys on that one. Being a vertically blessed fashionista myself, these past few seasons were harsh on me. Where the best of the shoe bunch were always 4+ inches high, I felt constantly deprived of my stylista rights. Now that all the big names in the industry are pairing their outfits with flats or kitten heels, I finally feel that I’m in full fashion control of my situation. So ladies, come Spring just throw on a flowy dress, swipe some nude bronzer on your cheeks, and flip flop away! *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Well the fact that Carrie chopped off her famous frizzy locks and opted for modernized glamour curls made me fall in love with short hair. In addition, Patty Field seemed to have solved the equation for mix-matched chic for this season. She started the whole stripes and florals trend, in addition to making it ok to wear your intimates as outerwear. Take a look at how we were inspired to interpret 2002 clothes to today.

It’s your ability to identify an item or at least find a similar substitute. Well I spotted this on Rachel Bilson, do you know where I can find that adorable hat? I have to have it!!” Thanks Huong, honestly we try our best . It was a pretty easy task to find out who Rachel’s bowler hat is by, but we have to admit there’s some bad news. Her Chanel Petite Felt Bowler goes for a whopping $1125! Yep, we know that only celebs are willing to put down that kind of cash for an accessory that they’ll probably wear 1-3 times ( if they didn’t get it for free by the designer). So we searched a bit more for some similar options. Happy Shopping!

It might have helped that Olivia Palermo herself was sitting right across from us. Honestly the both of us couldn’t stop staring! As soon as the show started, though, our focus directly shifted to the amazing clothing. Number one, can we say amazing pants??? Really Tibi never ceases to impress with her innovative take on pants each season. Also, the models were towering over us with their bubblegum lipstick and teased hair and I must say the effect was gorgeous. All in all, the show was a success and the collection will definitely be making itself into my Fall wardrobe. *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

But in a few rare cases, some celebrities actually have quite a hand in the final outcome. The latest celeb line news to hit the web is that Whitney Port, of The Hills and The City fame, is being sued by a former employee who claims to have had a large partaking in Whitney Eve’s design aesthetic. According to People.com , “Adrienne Baravetto alleges she had an oral agreement with Port and her father, including a $80,000 yearly salary plus a 25 percent stake in the [Whitney Eve] company. Baravetto also alleges that she did virtually all the design work and that the Ports haven’t paid her a dime. Port’s lawyer Michael A. Taitelman tells PEOPLE, “The lawsuit that Adrienne Baravetto filed on March 19, 2010 against Whitney Eve, Inc., Whitney Port and others regarding the Whitney Eve clothing line is baseless and without merit. Whitney Port is, and always has been, the designer of Whitney Eve. Baravetto worked for Whitney Eve for a short period of time ending in early 2008.” So who’s side are you taking?

That is until now. We can’t help but notice that these new House of Harlow sandals are a little bit too similar to the Dries van Notens that took the runways by a storm last summer. In her defense, though, we must say that we’re glad she didn’t go the way of some of her peers (ahem ahem Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton!) and knockoff the sandals completely but that they are maybe a little ‘too inspired’ for our taste. What do you think? Are they eerily the same, or are we insane?",

This season she has created her inaugural footwear collection for the store, which is available in time for London Fashion Week. These three spike-adorned heels (£150) hit shops and online on Feb. 5. What do you Chic- eristas think of these statement shoes? They kind of remind us of the Louboutin spiked heels, or the Rock & Rebuplic ones we posted about awhile back.

Quick question, what do you plan to wear with your Target vest; the black with silver accents vest that your friend tracked down for you? I bought one last week and am now wondering how to put it together!” Yes, the beloved Tarjay Bandleader Vest à la Balmain, pure genius. What we love about vests is the fact that they’re probably one of the most versatile pieces to have in a wardrobe. What we recommend for this specific vest, is to tone down the harshness of the black and metal with elements of, shall we say, girly-ness. Try pairing it with a floral dress, or for a more casual look you can go for a bohemian blouse and shorts. Finally, another way to wear it would be to follow Kim Kardashian’s lead and go with J Brand’s thrashed jeans , and a simple tank.

The Project Runway host was seen at Bryant Park in this pink number, eerily similar to Topshop’s outfit. So the main question here is who inspired who?! Personally I think it was a coincidence, but either way I’d never be caught dead in a nean pink pant+blazer look. This is a great example of something that looks great on a runway, but doesn’t really transcend easily into daily fashion. Seperate the two and you’ll look fine, but placing them together is just too Miami Vice for us. What do you think? *Images courtesy of perezhilton.com and flickr.com .

Honey, the chances of that happening are like 1 in a million. So to clarify, this is not me begging my readers to run out and get me the below mentioned. I just thought of giving you guys a look at what items have been lingering on my mind these days…. Hmm , come to think of it, I might have come off a bit harsh. I mean, if any of you out there just has to show their gratification, then no one’s stopping you.. So without further ado, if the economy wasn’t in the crapper, I’d so go and indulge on the following as a B-day treat ( ahem, May21May21May21 ): Edit : here are the links: *Images courtesy of shopbop.com, saks.com, igorandandre.blogspot.com.

As usual, it was important for me to help you achieve a similar look and you can easily do so with this Kenneth Jay Lane Multi Gem Necklace . Three hours and counting ya’ll..

From what we hear, there are already people lined up around the block and are assumed a minimum wait period of 2 hours! Guess a lot of bosses are getting the ‘ I’m not feeling that well gotta run to the Doctor’s ‘ excuse! Do you think Topshop is worth all the hype? Personally I’m not always huge fan of their products since, up close and personal, the quality sometimes isn’t really up to par. This used to be acceptable since Topshop’s pricepoint was low, but we’ve noticed a significant bump in their prices recently. On the other hand, we’re huge fans of the ‘Boutique’ brand they carry, which is a bit more high end and worth your buck. Would you wait in line for Topshop? *Image courtesy of nitrolicious.com .

Well let’s just say that after seeing the preview of the capsule collection (thanks to Nitrolicious as usual!) I am even more excited! The pieces are absolutely to die for and the quality looks fantastic. So much so that it’s hard to believe that the pieces are a cheaper version of the originals. The Jimmy Choo for H&M collection is slated to be in stores by November 14, 2009. I suggest you get there quick especially before I beat you to it!

But now to my question- I am holding a birthday party with a masquerade ball theme (gotta love Gossip Girl) and I need a dress and a mask. I don’t want to be predictable and I want to stand out. Got any ideas for looking chic under a budget?” Oh, if only we had a penny for every time Gossip Girl influenced our lives, mostly our wardrobes, then we’d be laughing all the way to the bank! So Leetal, since you’re hosting the bash, obviously you’ve got to have a look that no one else has thought of. One place we love shopping at is Etsy, since so many talented designers sell their one of a kind duds for unbelievable prices. Why not try purchasing a simple metallic dress , and pairing it with a ruffled bolero ? Add some beaded gloves , a and finally top it all off with an extravagant mask . Voila! The whole look for under $250! *Images courtesy of cwtv.com and etsy.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I want to purchase the perfect pair of skinny leather pants for winter. I don’t mean those flimsy AA leggings, that crack and leave crumbs after every wear. I mean either thick leggings (keep me warm) or really skinny leather pants a la Blake Lively. I love the folding effect they have, not too tight/not too loose. I think I finally found a pair (which I’ll probably order one size up) at VS. Yaay! *Images courtesy of victoriassecret.com and justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

The Eugenia Kim for Target collection is the first hat launch in a series of limited-time-only accessory designers at Target, featuring a range of hats that are on-trend and functional that fit into any budget. Inspired by Havana, Cuba, the collection includes cloche, fedora, sun-hat, bucket hat, newsboy and pillbox silhouettes using woven and printed fabrics with various embellishments. Her collaboration ranged from $15-$20, a huge difference from her usual $300 and up price range. We love Target! Can’t wait to buy a few for our summer endeavors. *Images courtesy of target.com.

I’m loving my time here, from checking out the sites to, of course, shopping till my feet feel like they will literally crumble to ashes. One of my fave shopping destinations has obviously been ( is this too cliche? ) Topshop. I know, I know, everyone raves and rumbles on about the high street store, but they literally are telling the truth. Now, don’t get me wrong, the store has some awful, cheap finds, but for the most part there are great alternatives to expensive trends. One of my personal choices in Topshop is their higher end Boutique label. I had to show you guys an item I would’ve otherwise swiped my cursor over online, this Peplum Jacket . In reality, the fit is amazing, nipped right at the waist for a flattering form fitting jacket. Unfortunately, my size was sold out in store and online, so someone live through my fantasy, purchase it for yourself, and tell me what you think. *Image courtesy of topshop.com .

If it were us, we’d add a belt to cinch in the waist, and eliminate the “ how dare she leave the house with no pants on ” look. This is key to any shirt-dress you’d like to pull off. In addition, we’d add a hot pair of gladiators for definition. It’s enough that the loose blouse makes her look like she’s missing pants, so nude flats giving off the impression of no shoes is a major nono .

We’re loving their play on preppy pretty, the styling is point on. Best part about it is that these outfits won’t break the bank.

A ring that represented each girl’s style down pat. We selected this Jessica Kagan Cushman Brass Skull and Crystals Ring for Mark Kate since she’s such a free spirit with a grungy edge. For the more classic Ashley, we decided on this Lauren G. Adams Gold Enamel Horse Themed Ring honestly because it gives off this classy equestrian vibe that depicts her style perfectly.

We have the first images of the collaboration between British fashion icon Mr. Williamson and the beloved Swedish high street label H&M! The exclusive women’s collection is set to hit selected stores on April 23, 2009, followed by another Summer range for women and men from mid-May. An H&M spokeswoman said the “exclusive” women’s range would be carried in about 200 stores, with the second delivery slated for all of its 1,700 stores. Keep in mind, the line is not cheap, since the materials used are pretty expensive, but they don’t go as high as actual MW pieces.

They are exactly what I need right now!” Actually Kacia, we dedicated a post a while back to these Free People booties that bare quite the resemblance to the $1,250 Chloe’s, and for $198! But we decided to go ahead and search for a few more options that might interest you like these Steve Madden Testud Black Leather booties or these Toughy Suede ones ( love the names btw…toughy and stud? ).

I saw a picture of one of the Olsen twins wearing a basic lightweight floor-length cardigan, and the Spring 2011 Elizabeth and James line has a black one. The only ones I could find were either too much or cost over $1000! I was wondering if you could help me find a reasonably priced maxi cardigan to rock before the spring. Thank you!” Wow, we love how most of these Ask Chic posts are about the Olsen twins clothing. Just goes to show you how coveted their style is. We even posted about how hot we thought this cardigan was a while ago. Why not try this ASOS version for $79 or this Eternal Sunshine Creations cardi for $152?

I love the contrast of the blush tone dress with Julianne’s fiery red hair and the turquoise dress with Amanda’s golden blond locks. Put them together and they compliment each other perfectly. Of course I had to go on a wild goose chase to attempt the same looks. In Amanda’s case I think I found her exact same dress but in Julianne’s I had to create an ‘inspired by’ ensemble. Either way choose any of these looks and we guarantee you’ll be a hit!

We kind of like the fact that Steve Madden is sometimes, hmm inspired , by the big honcho stylish brands. Let’s take a look at the following example. These Pour La Victoire Glory Studded Flat Sandals , which retail for $225. I’ve been eying them for the past couple of weeks, but didn’t take that extra ‘click’ into the shopping basket since I couldn’t justify their worth. Now, fast forward to this morning, when I spotted these Steve Madden Picolo sandals , for $112. Yes! Half the price of the originals, and totally worth the purchase. Bonus, use code CJDAD20 at checkout (expires 6/12) for an extra 20% off..yes ladies you can get them for $89 !!! And that is why I love Steve Madden. *Images courtesy of their respective links.

These beauties have the ability to complement any outfit and add an instant aura of ‘fashion know how.’ Make sure to match your headband style with your clothing style,though, (for example never wear a hippie style headband with a structured LBD) because this powerful accessory can easily go from friend to enemy. We chose a few of our favourites below from hippie, to flapper, to elegant and honestly want to purchase every single one. Since we can’t, we’ll sign off by saying “please give these babies a good home!” 1. Gabriela Artigas Red Horn Headband 2. Young, Fabulous & Broke Silk Headband in Cream 3.

Can you please tell me where I can get the same one?” Wow Maria! You read our mind! After seeing the exact same picture we were planning to do a Celeb Chic post about it since we loved the look as much as you did. Well, we were able to identify the dress and it’s the Mayle Florinda Jersey Dress and retails for $475. Enjoy this beautiful dress cuz it was hard to find (it’s sold out almost everywhere!!)… *Image courtesy of justjared.com and mayleonline.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Not many socialites would walk around town in Zara, which she does a lot , let alone wear something last season. This is what we love about Olivia. We might not agree with all her actions on the show, but we do agree with her keeping it real and going about fashion like the rest of us. Check her out here carrying her last season Chloé “Gemma” satchel all over during New York Fashion Week. *Images courtesy of people.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

                            "post_text_content": "November 19, 2008 | Tags: Chic Find So sometimes, only when I’m bored, I like to go back and revisit certain runway shows just to see if there were any details I missed the first time around. Well it happened recently with the Phillip Lim Spring 2009 show and let’s just say I did notice an extra detail or two. This time what caught my attention was the cute side halo/bun do that all the models had going on. This style would be really cute when paired with an ethereal holiday dress. I’m thinking something white and flowy and some very soft makeup. To get the look: 1. Flatiron hair to make it stick straight and add a shine serum to finish. 2. Split hair into two sections in order to make a side part. Make sure one section is significantly larger than the other. 3. Take the larger section of hair and twist and pin to make a slick side bun. 4. Now, take the remaining section of hair and wrap around the head along the nape of the neck and pin ends behind the bun to conceal and VOILA! A look fit for an angel. *Images courtesy of style.com .

The energy in the room was contageous, and the bright colors of her designs helped spread the vibe. The electric colors were a fresh change to the pastels we witnessed all week, and we can’t wait to don a few of her pieces ASAP.

I even had one of those Hello Kitty travel kits with the little toothbrush, soap, face towel, and lip balm. Remember those? I remember I was so in love with it that I was afraid to use it. I don’t think I ever actually did. Ah the memories! Anyways, this all came back to me when I read about MAC’s new collaboration with Hello Kitty to develop an exclusive makeup line. For those of you that are just excited as me, it’ll be available in stores starting February. Now if I can only find that travel kit… *Image courtesy of wwd.com .

Luckily, unlike most of the dresses Kate has worn on the red carpet, this dress is available for all us normal folk to buy. Get it here . Don’t-Cha love us a lil’ bit more now??? *Images courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

So yes ladies, I am now ready to indulge on the fashions across the pond. I noticed that women in the UK love trends, and more so they enjoy donning them from head to toe. Fashion faux pas? Actually not. The fact that they approach fashion and style with such ease and naturalism (the whole ‘I just rolled into my closet and came up with this’ ) excused the ‘don’t wear more than one trend at a time’ rule. Take a look at the top trends I took note of in the United Kingdom and feel free to implement them on yourselves: *Images courtesy of elle.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

With The Hills on hiatus for the summer (counting the days till our guilty pleasure hits MTV in August), we can’t help but go to the paps pics for some fashion inspiration from the small screen diva. What really attracted us to this certain pic was the chic outfit that’s so achievable by any standard. Obviously you’ll need the body to pull off high waisted short shorts , (which we recommend alternating the look with high waisted trouser pants if you don’t have a tiny torso), and a billowy top . Of course she wouldn’t be LC if she didn’t finish off the outfit with her signature Loubs .

Miroslava Duma, the girl with all the Hermes bags and LV scarves anyone can dream of, is a well known editor from Moscow whose work started at Harper’s Bazaar Russia and is now a contributor to L’Officiel Russia, Glamour Russia, the style section at Russian OK Magazine, and Tatler Magazine Russia. Obviously working for all those reputable fashion magazines must contribute to her great style, but Miro manages to add a quirky twist to any outfit she’s wearing. Take a look at our fave looks below and get ready for some major style envy. *Images courtesy of purseblog.com thesartorialist.blogspot.com and styleandthecity.com.

The starlet has decided to abandon the boho-glam direction of the first collection in favor of a more mature, sleeker, and predominately black and white collection. I am loving the fringed collar top, the double breasted vest, and the cape. I also love the styling of the pieces in the Great Gatsby theme lookbook. Also, it’s refreshing to see that the pieces are definitely worth the investment this time around. What do you think, is this collection better than the first? *Images courtesy of instyle.com .

                            "post_text_content": "March 23, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview We hold a special place in our hearts for our latest Chic Interviewee. Why you may ask? She not only shares similar interests in fashion, but our same heritage, which is quite rare in the blogosphere. Taghrid, a 21 year old residing in sunny LA, has gained a mass following for her unique approach to style. This ‘chirping’ girl, the meaning of her Arabic name , will surely fly far in her fashionable future. Take a look at what she had to say and then head on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: We’ve gotta get the obvious question out of the way: So Taghrid, what got you into blogging? Taghrid: I have always been interested in fashion, but never really had an outlet to express my enthusiasm about it especially since neither my school nor work had anything to do with style or the fashion industry. After faithfully following many excellent blogs for a few months I decided to start one of my own. I guess I figured since I dress up everyday anyway, it would be fun and give me and excuse to obsess over shoes and clothes. Chic Intuition: There are tons of perks that come with one’s recognition in the blogosphere. Please indulge on your top fave occurrences as a result of your site. Taghrid: My favorite “perk” is definitely being connected to all kinds of amazing people who I would have never crossed paths with otherwise. I’m really appreciative of all the love and support that I have received through my blog through readers as well as professionals within the industry. Everything from meeting new friends to working with local designers and photographers has really been great. It really is a surprisingly positive and embracing community and I’m just really thankful that I am able to participate in it. Chic Intuition: As a graphic artist, do you feel that your art transcends into your personal style and vice versa? Taghrid: Because my graphic design work is really customer based and I create products that are designed to fit their marketing and merchandising needs I am usually not afforded as much creative freedom as with my dressing. However, as with any craftsman, my work definitely has my personal stamp whether I am designing divot repair tools and bag tags for a country club or revamping a metal band’s MySpace. Chic Intuition: What’s your top dream purchase for Summer 09? Taghrid: I can’t get Charles Anastase’s SS09 runway platforms off my mind ! So so dreamy. Oh and since we’re dreaming about summer must haves, a 1956 Porsche Speedster in candy red would be perfection. Chic Intuition: As Arabs ourselves, we were so giddy when we found a stylish girl from similar descent (so rare in the blogosphere!). Does your background affect the way you dress? We once remember spotting you in a Lebenese Debkeh vest, and thought your pairing it with a flowy dress was genious… Taghrid: I am proud of my heritage and culture and I definitely try to embrace it as much as possible. I grew up in Lebanon a place where style is greatly appreciated and revered. I accompanied my mother to chic lady lunches where I observed my mom, aunts, and their fabulous friends as they spoke of what they were cooking and had turkish coffee and Knaffeh in their classy custom tailored suits and dresses. Oh and I ADORE vintage Egyptian movies from the 50s and 60s where the wardrobes were as adorable as the love stories. A large part of my visual aesthetic is based in Lebanese ideals, I just put my own twist on it. Arabs in general don’t get much credit for how fashionable we really are, I am happy to be a catalyst for changing that. Some of the world’s most amazing designers are my homeboys! Chic Intuition: And finally philosophical question time: How frilly is too frilly?! Taghrid: When you border on looking like a giant Betsey-Johnson-birthday-cake, it’s too frilly. *Images courtesy of taghrid.cc . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Each category — bridal, bridesmaid, mother of the bride, and guest — provides a selection of designer dresses and accessories (shoes, bags, etc). We think this idea is genius, but might take away from the fun of shopping for your dress with mom/maid of honor/familia. Come to think of it, you could have mom come over and peek at the screen… *Image courtesy of net-a-porter.com",

Love the look but it’s bit pricey for my budget. Many thanks.” Hey Anna! We are just as in love with this piece as your are! So in love, as a matter of fact, that we bought it for ourselves and convinced a friend to postpone picking up her kids from school to get the same one. Yes, I know, bad influence but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. So anyways, unfortunately despite it’s hotness this blazer is a bit pricey so we understand your need for a similar one at a lower price point… How’s $29.62 for ya? Low enough? Yes it’s true, I found this very similar INC International Concepts Long Belted Vest for that insanely good price. Get it quick though, because I’m sure once the other readers see this they’ll snatch it up right away.",

Could you do a look for less for this ensemble? Thanks so much!” Why, Thank You Angie! Really sweet words, we’re kinda blushing. We too were obsessing over Molly’s look ( I mean, Rachel Zoe is her stylist, lucky! ) It took us a while, but we were able to compile a look for the total of…..*drum roll please*…$217!!!

Their items are simple, unique, and just divine! Even though a lot of people would steer away from putting down $300 for a bracelet, we know that you’ll be investing in a lifelong piece. For those of you out there that just felt my last sentence was full of …., well, there’s a cheaper version available now! Bing Bang has collaborated with Urban Outfitters, and debuted a more affordable line for the masses. For items 1/10th of the price, we say go for it ! *Images courtesy of urbanoutfitters.com .

To be honest, the only one them that managed to look hot was Miss Audrina. Other than that, I thought Lauren’s look was lackluster and her messy do was a bit too messy, Lo’s outfit was completely ill-fitting and just plain old blah, Heidi’s cleavage was a bit too out there , and that Whitney looked like a complete mess with her weird headress and random dress choice (where was the NY style sophistication we were all expecting?). Don’t even get me started on Stephanie and Holly’s weird looks… Is it me or is everything about The Hills becoming a bit old? Any thoughts on it being picked up for a new season??? *Images courtesy of popsugar.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

It’s from Forever21 , and it’s honestly one of the best purchases I’ve made under $15. So I decided to go online and buy them in bulk ( they’ve sold out, argh) , when I spotted this photo on their Sweaters main page. It seemed to be giving off an eerily similar vibe to Alexander Wang’s Fall collection. Check out their take on the Alexander Wang Rocco Mini Duffel Bag (meh) or the distressed sweater . We’ve already talked about how some brands actually went to the extreme of suing Forever21 over copyright infrigment, so do you think Wang might be the latest to hop onto this legal bandwagon? *Images courtesy of style.com and their respective links.

You feel like it’s a goldmine, and you’re the only one allowed to prance around in it. But after a while, it gets a bit lonely, and dark, and you start to feel a tad bit guilty for not spreading the love. A few years back I found the motherload of designer brands online, and no it’s not Net-a-Porter . I honesty l did not mention it to friends and family, and when they saw me carrying my new Balenciaga or those hot D&G shoes and inquired, I simply stated ‘ Oh, I got them online ‘. (Come on, give me some slack, at least I didn’t lie!) I later felt ridiculous (and by later a I mean a few years) and finally broke. I started mentioning the website to my sisters, family and friends, and they instantly fell in love. Now, I am ready to tell YOU. It’s an Italian website by the name of LUISAVIAROMA and it is divine . Need a hot, sold out everywhere else designer item off the runway? They’ve probably got it. Click here and snoop around. Just don’t be as greedy as me, and share it with those deserving. *Image courtesy of luisaviaroma.com.",

Ok, so maybe there are a few deviations here and there, but overall in shape, size and color the pairs are close. Same brand? Well…kinda. They are both designed by Marc Jacobs, but one is under his high end line and the other is his diffusion (aka lower priced) line. Do we sense a glitch in the system? Or are we just that good at finding you anything you want at any price point? I don’t know, you take your pick $98 or $295 ??? *Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

First rule, don’t match your clothing with your brightly colored tote. A neon bag and neon tee is so… Paris Hilton-y . Try wearing nude tones, anything from grays to beige’s do the job wonderfully. Just remember, don’t start wearing your colorful shoulder candy till the sun starts shining. Love how a vibrant bag looks again a nice tan… *Images courtesy of asos.com .

Anyways, the real reason I’m writing is in the hope that you can track down a necklace that Nicole Kidman is wearing on the front of the latest Australian issue of InStyle. The necklace is gorgeous and I must own it! Please help!” Well Mel, we can honestly say that the second we laid eyes on Nicole’s photo, we had a feeling who the designer was. It’s a dead ringer for a Chanel fine jewelry design. The pearl and bow scream ‘French Fashion House”, and we can’t agree with you more on how hot it is. But since we don’t have access to InStyle Australia, we can’t give you a sure answer. Try contacting your local Chanel for further information. On the other hand, we found a few similar versions for much less here , here and here . Good luck and happy hunting! *Images courtesy of gofugyourself.com and their respective links.

There are 31 new members which include some of our personal faves: Alexander Wang, Jason Wu, Chris Benz, and Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen! Wow, well deserved bunch. Manhattan’s Four Seasons restaurant will host an intimate group of CFDA members, retailers and editors at an Oct. 21 reception for the new inductees. Can’t wait to see the red carpet at that event. Here’s to more success for the young designers, and hopes for great, new talents to receive their well deserved recognition in the future as well. *Images courtesy of zimbio.com , mkashley.com , and closetdiaries.com .

Not only are designers bringing back the outrageous fashions of the 80s, but even the bold makeup and punk hairdos were moonlighting on the Fall 2009 runways. One designer in specific, Mr Marc Jacobs (♥♥♥!) himself took it to a whole new level! The extreme hair and makeup at his show really made an amazing effect. Shop here for some products from MAC that will help you achieve a similar look. Oh and make sure to tone it down a little. 80s beauty may be hot on the runways but I don’t think the streets are ready for it quite yet! *Images courtesy of style.com.

Ya, I’m not digging this brief. First off, what the heck is a Santum?! Sounds like an unflattering body organ if you ask me. Yes, we googled it, and no it’s not a word. So does MTV think that if they create a snazzy word, viewers are actually going to like the show more? Umm, no. We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt, and take that it’s a typo (they probably meant sanctum: An inviolably private place ). We thought we wouldn’t start off by judging the brief, and decided on giving the show a chance. We wish we had judged them. Bar Ravaeli is an amazing model, but an awkward host. It was really hard to follow her choppy sentences. Let. Us. Take. A. Look. At…..you get where we’re going. The ideas for the segments were great, but we felt like they were too many for a 20 minute show. Only part we liked was Erin Featherston’s dinner party (more about that tomorrow). Sigh . Sorry, we might seem a bit harsh but we expected more from MTV. Did any of you catch it? *Images courtesy of mtv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

You know, just the kids nominated by one of the most prestigious fashions forums, CFDA/ Vogue Fashion Fund. And every year, I sit waiting patiently in front of my laptop for the items to drop online to feed my fashion appetite. I honestly still wear my Doo.Ri scarf neck blouse religiously from ’06. Who’s in the crowd this year!? The pack includes none other than fashion guru Alexander Wang! The theme for this year seems to be khaki, and though I’m not a fan of the fabric, I wouldn’t mind getting my hands on the patterned dresses. Swoon . Items will be released June 16th. *Images courtesy of racked.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Your fashion tips are awesome! I wanted to ask you for some fashion tips, since your are sooo good at giving them. I just bought a long sleeveless cardi/vest (black) but I don’t know how to wear it. Can u give me some tips?? For work as well as casual outings please .” Hi Dayana. Thank you so much for your kind words! We love giving you guys fashion tips (kinda like going shopping with our girlfriends). I too am a huge fan of the sleeveless cardi! I love the fact that you can dress it up and down and instantly look like a fashionista. Here are just two of many great looks that I’ve compiled for you with this versatile piece. Sorry I chose a charcoal one but black will look just as great. Good luck! *Images courtesy of forever21.com and NET-A-PORTER.COM . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Well, for those of you that haven’t, there’s an annoying contestant (who will remain nameless) that thrives on adding ‘-licious ‘ to every single noun, adjective, and verb out there. At first I thought it was kind of cute, but now I’m starting to cringe every time he does it. We know that last season it was ‘fierce’ that caught on, and Christian Siriano will probably trademark the word. Got me thinking, if I were to add an ending to any fashionable noun out there what would it be? Skirt! And who should I bestow the skirtilicious honor upon? *Image courtesy of net-a-porter.com .

But when we first saw this handbag, we thought it was a joke, as in “ oh hehe what a funky piece of photoshopped work!! Wonder what the artist was trying to convey?? ” Something about poverty, and not enough hands to carry the bag. Or about how society today is hungry for the materialistic, so much so that the artist added excess handles. You know, the usual. Readers, this is an actual bag.

After yesterday’s post of MK wandering around LA after leaving LAX, we found this image of Ashley leaving the same airport. Notice how similar but different their outfits are. The concept is basically the same: travel/comfort chic. But the execution is totally different. Though MK opted to go for the homeless look, Ashley manages to appear pretty well put together. They key is to balance fitted and loose clothing. Yes, you heard us. There’s a detailed equation that goes with the layering trend, and we’re going to show you how it’s done. Take note at Exhibit A’s choice of pairing leggings with her loose (but tailored) coat. Now Exhibit B on the other hand, goes for an extremely long, floor dragging length coat ( don’t even want to know how many germs she has following her ) and adds a very long scarf and long tee under it as well. If it were up to us, we’d loose the scarf, shorten the coat a bit, and add a wide belt to the whole look. Voila. There you have it ladies. The secret to layering success. *Images courtesy of olsen-files.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

The only problem? I would never pay almost $2000 for a dress to wear out on a leisurely day walking the streets of LA. It needed an occasion and yet I couldn’t help thinking that I liked the idea of wearing it with a pair of shoe booties and some sunglasses nonchalantly on a day out on the town. Well, the dress in question has been sold out for quite some time now but I happened to stumble upon a surprising alternative. This Heaven on Earth Ra Ra Button Through Dress is almost identical to the Fendi and at $260 is a fashionable steal!

We can’t help but mention it, especially since I’m an architect and dabble in interior design myself. Ever since the start of The City , I’ve been eying the apartments of the stars and have to admit that each and everyone of them either has killer interior taste or some major mula that allows them the convenience of a fab Upper East Side Interior Decorator. Let’s take a look at Exhibit A: Olivia Polermo’s apartment. The secret to her stylish abode is credited towards her interior designer mother and the fact that her trust fund allows her the comfort of unlimited furniture selections; so the girl’s basically working with two advantages. That point aside, we still think that with the right theme and attitude, anyone can create a similar space. Olivia’s apartment has “a 1960s look with a classic, old Hollywood feel”, which we just adore. The fact that her space is retro, means that it’s timeless and thus little Oli will never get bored in its vicinity. Just remember that shopping for furniture is not like shopping for clothes, a trick that Olivia’s mom taught her, “you need to think of the look of the entire apartment.” Touche! *Images courtesy of nypost.com .

He’s so talented, sweet and snarky at the same time. If you’re a fan as well, then you’ll be happy to know that he’s signed on to judge the 14th Season of America’s Next Top Model. Starting March 10, you will be able to watch the editor-at-large for Vogue USA give his opinions as a guest judge; he will take the place of J. Alexander, who will now coach strutting to the models. How does Talley’s boss, Anna Wintour, feel about his latest gig? “I think his latest adventure sounds like a lot of fun and I look forward to watching him on the program.” Do you agree? *Images courtesy of wwd.com .

The public looooves it. What about us? Well we’ve hearted some and hated some, but it all comes down to personal taste and final product quality. So onto the latest designer de jour: surfer dude Tracy Feith. His collection is colorful, playful, and just damn cute. Can’t wait to get our hands on those 60s inspired dresses!! The line comes out May 17th, so mark your calendars. P.S. Is it just us, or does it seem like The City’s Allie is modeling here as well? *Images courtesy of target.com.

Long, flowy dresses paired with hobo bags, dangling necklaces and headbands seem like the uniform of choice for this expecting mama. We even recommend this look for the non-preggers of the bunch as well, since anyone can pull it off with a cinch. Just remember, not every maxi dress is flattering. I know, flattering and pregnant shouldn’t go in the same sentence in any scenario, but take a few pointers from Ashlee and know what works best on your bod… *Images courtesy of justjared.com .

Now that I think of it, how in the world would I allow myself to touch a frog is beyond me! Anyways, it seems like Mr. Jacobs likes frogs as well. The inspiration for the clasp on this bag is just divine, and I’m loving the orang ish red. We first posted on the wristlet version of this bag that Fergie was seen carrying. Honestly, I love this larger version more, and unfortunately it’s not available anywhere online. For those of you wondering, the bag is my cousin’s and the photo was taken by my sister who’s just started dabbling in photography.",

But what adds to the hot factor is how you accessorize it. Take a look at Rachel for example. She’s paired her ethereal dress with a black leather belt and patent t-straps. Other people might have opted to go for nude pumps and nothing else, but in Rachel Bilson’s case the contrasting color adds a whole other dimension that we’re digging. Like her look? We decided to re-create the whole thing for under $250! Happy Shopping!

Around two to three models actually met the runway face to face, while a few others managed to avoid the encounter by slipping and sliding around. The crowd was seen applauding when the models got up (double embarrassment). Personally, every time I see a model fall on the runway, I blush. I can’t help but feel for these girls who have to manage balancing in sky high heels, while walking ferociously down an uncomfortably sleek and slippery runway with an audience of hundreds and cameras by the dozen. Awkward designed pumps: not chic. A slip and slide for a runway: not chic at all . *Images courtesy of fashionologie.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Of course, there’s a limit to how far one should go (no boxers under your boyfriend jeans ladies), but playing parts sure does make a difference on the mood. Let’s say I have a presentation to make, the minute I throw on my over-sized blazer I just know that the freak from the competitive department will not want to debate my designs. But if I’m in the mood for some attention, I just throw on a cute dress, pop some color on my lips and oh so glamorously sway around the cafe. This is how fashion is actually a factor in life changing moments. I love.

What we covet most about her look, and the fact that made it post-worthy, is her pairing of grays with a shot of purple. Keep note ladies: when you want to add a splash of chic to any otherwise dull ensemble, color is always the way to go. Just remember to keep the color at a minimum (one piece) and you’re ready to go. Rachel is donning the LV leopard scarf, but we assumed you, like us, might be getting a little tired of all the spots we’ve been posting. We decided to pair our alternative look with a blue zebra scarf. Happy Shopping!

                            "post_text_content": "May 10, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview Since we were on quite a Chic Interview dry spell, we’ve lined up a number of amazing bloggers for the next couple of weeks, and we’re sure their stylish greatness will erase any grudges we had for our shortcomings. Our next blogger, Aimee Song, is one we’ve been following for a while. Turns out she reciprocates the love. What a small cyberworld we live in. Hailing from San Fran, this 23 year old is the definition of Beautiful Blogger. Read on for some fun and then pay her a visit . Chic Intuition: We just have to start off by stating that you are gorge! (that’s Chic for gorgeous). What’s your beauty regime? Aimee: Thank you! Because I have sensitive skin, I avoid putting too much make up on. I only draw my eyebrows and wear blush. When I go out, I’ll put eyeliner on. I take showers daily at night and remove my make up with Aveeno Cleanser and after the shower dab on Lush’s Dream Cream, which is all natural so it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin plus it keeps it very moisturized. If I every have dry spots, I’ll dab on Aquaphor on my skin. Chic Intuition: You seem to have a lot of friends in the blogosphere. Did you meet after you started Song of Style, or did the clique form through a cyberspace connection? Aimee: I met all of my blog friends after I started Song of Style. It’s amazing how many stylish bloggers that are actually really nice and friendly that live in San Francisco. Although I haven’t become friends with every blogger I met, the ones that I did become friends with are so amazing that I’ll probably have them for life. Chic Intuition: You have a jewelry collection that would cause envy in any stylish girl. What’s your fave piece and why? Aimee: Most of my favorite pieces are ones I’ve gotten from my grandmother. There is this one gold snake bracelet I used to wear everyday until I broke it, so now I have replaced it with a similar version of Kenneth Jay Lane’s panther bracelet I found at the Fairfax Flea Market. My citizen watch which I have also gotten from my grandma is my other favorite. Chic Intuition: We have something in common, you study interior architecture, one of us at CI is an architect. What do you think the connection between architecture and fashion is? Aimee: Oh wow, that’s amazing that one of u guys are an architect! Well, both in architecture and fashion, most of the time we try to create a comfortable yet inspiring experience for people. We deal with structure and shape and both architecture and fashion tell the social background of its inhabitants. I think I’m noticing the connection a lot more nowadays especially in interior design and fashion as both deal with fabrics. Chic Intuition: Would you choose comfort over style or the opposite? Aimee: Both are very important for me. I probably sacrifice both to a certain extent. I’ll never wear painful kitten heels in the hills of San Francisco but I do wear platform heels or wedges even if they aren’t as comfortable as tennis shoes. However, no matter how lazy and sick I am, I will never wear sweatpants. There is a reason why Fashion Gods created leggings. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how designer is too designer? Aimee: Let’s just say if you drive a car with Gucci logos all around the interior, umm that’ll be too designer. *Images courtesy of songofstyle.blogspot.com .

Remember the interview we did with the talented Francesca a while back? She so kindly rewarded us with a choice of any design, and I knew which one to choose instantaneously. The tee screams me, and I could imagine numerous outfit combos to dress is up or down. So you could only image how I excited I was once my package arrived. The tee was exactly what I expected and more. I loved the longer length in the back ( no need to worry about the junk in this trunk ), and it looked fab with a long chained necklace and skinnies. The only negative I could give was that after a wash, the fabric was affected (the seams ruffled a bit), but some might differ to say they love items that look like they’ve been through some wear and tear. To those of you seeking an affordable fix, head on over to her boutique. I just did, and I’m kinda eyeing her oversized box tee . Happy Shopping! *Image courtesy of etsy.com.

Don’t ask why, but I’m so into huge earrings these days. I guess my ears are bored of studs and crave some weight on ’em! Normally, someone would think that earrings of those colors would be difficult to pair with an outfit, but we decided to prove our case and show how they’d look just fab with three totally different dresses.

I know the 80s are in, with all its glory (and sometimes gory) details. Bicycling shorts, neon’s, high hair, in addition to the aforementioned trend are all back with a vengeance. Honestly, I think this is the first time I spot splattered jeans and have fallen in love. Does her perfect body have anything to do with it? Maybe. But I know that when I place these babies in my shopping basket, I won’t feel any remorse ( like I do about my childhood photos, thanks Mom! ).

Please help me find a fun stylish top I could wear with this skirt to get an idea as to what colour and style I should be looking at.” We’d like to applaud your great fashion insight since translucent maxi skirts are very in this season Bridget. Your choice of wearing biker shorts is unique, and we’d also recommend trying a pencil skirt underneath as well. Concerning what to wear with your lace skirt, the best part about this item is that you can either dress it up or down. Why not try a loose button down denim shirt for mornings out with a pair of sandals, and then take the look to the next level with a sequined blazer and pumps? Either way, we guarantee you’ll look smashing. Good luck! *Images courtesy of shopbop.com and net-a-porter.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

For a rookie, a rising star per say, Freida has managed to look absolutely gorgeous at every event she’s attended so far and even on a day out on the streets of LA. It seems that, like any other rising fashion star, I’ve been holding my breath for the last two months waiting for the inevitable slip-up and yet it hasn’t happened! That’s why before it’s too late I would like to crown Freida Pinto as my fave new style star. Wow! Chalk up another point for Slumdog Millionaire!

And the resulting boot has a unique DNA of luxurious practicality.” For her part, Jimmy Choo founder and President Tamara Mellon said she was inspired by the images of stylish British girls wearing wellies. “This led to our collaboration with Hunter to produce a sleek interpretation of the British classic,” Mellon said. via WWD . The pair is being sold for a pretty reasonable price of $395 ( reasonable for designer shoes, we mean ) at Jimmy Choo stores worldwide and online starting next June. *Images courtesy of jimmychoo.com , hunterboots.com , and wwd.com .

Not really looking forward to 90s flashbacks of denim on denim (major faux pas) or the extremely cropped denim jacket (not flattering on any figure), we decided to approach this trend with caution. Now that we’ve seen some major fashionistas on the go with their fave new accessory, we admit that the trend is growing on us. Take a look at how Rihanna and Nicole both pair their denim jackets with maxi dresses, just fab! I have to admit that I’m a bit relieved I didn’t throw out my fave jeans jacket! *Images courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

She’s a 21 year old stylist who lives in Sweden, and blogs to our heart’s content. Her array of poses combined with ethereal photography and, of course, sensational outfits is what keeps us browsing Fashion Squad on a daily basis. Consider this interview a free styling session! Enjoy loves! Chic Intuition: Usually people get attracted to certain blogs based on the content, concept, or inspirational images. To be honest, (no matter how superficial this sounds) we were attracted to your beauty. Talk about model material! Do you ever think about modeling? Carolina: I’m very flattered, but no. Modeling is not for me, I rather lurk around behind the scenes. Chic Intuition: I was discussing this with my co-editor the other day, I’m actually contemplating a trip to Sweden based on the stylish senses of all the Swedish blogs!! Please tell me that not ALL of the Swedes dress this good. There has to be SOME fashion no nos, no? Carolina: People in Sweden are over all quite well dressed, but no worries, we do have a lot of fashion roadkills too! 😉 Chic Intuition: The photography used in your blog is just exquisite. It speaks all languages. Who takes the pictures for you, and what camera do they use? Carolina: Thank you very much! I actually take most of the pictures myself with a self-timer and I use a Canon eos 350d with a 17-55 mm lens from Tamron. Chic Intuition: What we gather from your writings is that you’re a stylist. For those interested, can you brief us on a typical day on the job? Carolina: I work as a freelance stylist so I don’t have a 9 to 5 job. Working as a stylist equals really long days, lot’s of heavy stuff to carry around and being poorly paid, so you need to be really passionate about fashion. But you also get to meet lot’s of inspiring people and I absolutely love my job. Chic Intuition: When did you finally nailed your personal style? Do you feel like it might evolve fashion-wise later on? Carolina: God yes, my style has been evolving since I was just a kid and it will probably keep on doing so for the rest of my life. Chic Intuition: If you were forced to live with just ONE accessory for the rest of your life, what would you choose and why? Carolina: My hat! perfect for bad hairdays or when I just want to be a little mystical, haha! Chic Intuition: Contemplation of the day: how baggy is too baggy? Carolina: A little baggy is ok, but when you trip and fall because of your baggy pants, it’s a major sign that it’s time to get a belt. *Images courtesy of fashionsquad.com .

According to WWD , the collection is slated to hit 200 Macy’s doors and macys.com on August 3rd and for the face of the brand, Madonna has personally handpicked a celebrity which will be unveiled at the end of July (hint: she’s on a hit teen drama series and is known for her rocker style off-screen). Why do we have a feeling its Taylor Momsen?! We love the photos so far, but can’t wait to see how they look/feel up close. I’m personally eying the flannel with lace insert blouse and studded leather jacket. The Material Girl collection includes apparel, footwear, handbags, jewelry and hair accessories, with most items retailing for between $12 and $40. *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com .

                            "post_text_content": "August 12, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview We were extremely excited about interviewing this chic 28 year-old who hails from London but currently resides in NY. Karen’s blog opened up tons of opportunities for her, like modeling in the latest Rachel by Rachel Roy collection. Awestruck? You should be, but just remember that anything fab can happen to you too. Oh, and we also had to know how she met the queen of the fashion world, Kate Lanphear! What do we love most about Karen? The fact that she admits to the urge of talking about fashion/shopping all day. Our kinda girl! Take a look at what she had to say and then head on over to her amazing blog . Chic Intuition: From your site we compiled the following facts: you’re a model, you love fashion and anything DIY, and you’re a blogger. So smart of us huh? We love how the focus of your blog is actually on what you’re wearing, we sometimes tire of the personal therapy sessions other bloggers tend to drag on. What’s your goal behind Where Did U Get That? Karen: I LOVE clothes and shopping. Always have. So I could talk about that all day long. I’ve been doing so already for years with friends and anyone else who will listen long enough before their eyes glaze over. It was one of the reasons that I started a blog. I sometimes get asked where did I get something that I’m wearing, plus people assumed that I worked in the fashion industry (I wish!), so I thought ok I really need to do SOMETHING. Hence the blog was born. There’s no real goal for it except to just get better and better in terms of content and hopefully I would LOVE if it in some way helped me break into the fashion industry in some form or another. I’ve had a really amazing time though in such a short period and have been given some amazing opportunities along the way, like modeling for the Rachel Rachel Roy new diffusion line now out at Macy’s across the country. Chic Intuition: Congrats on finally getting your hands on the coveted Sam Edelman Zoe Boots ! On a scale from 1-10, how much do these babies up the outfit hotness factor in your mind? Karen: Hmmm. 1 – 10? I’d give them roughly 55? Seriously they are unreal. I strongly urge you to get your hands on a pair pronto. I waited years for these and am so glad that they got re-released. I almost fainted when I heard. The fashion gods had spoken. Chic Intuition: We had to take a breath when we spotted this pic of you and Kate Lanphear. Spill!! Karen: My stylist friend told me about a fashion industry party at the Soho Grand hotel and so I had to go. Neither of us expected to see Kate there, let alone actually speak to her!! She’s one of my style icons. Effortless, timeless rock chick chic. My friend Tay Trong went up to her and just started chatting. I joined in and have to say she is so down to earth and very humbled. Zero attitude. Like someone I would actually hang out with had I not known who she was. It was so humid that evening though so beauty wise I felt like I looked like something the cat dragged in. Isn’t it always that way? The day that you most needed to look your best for something unexpected, you look the exact opposite? Chic Intuition: What advice would you give any aspiring model? How do you crack into the industry? Karen: I was selected from Lucky Magazine (after they saw my blog), for a casting call for the Rachel Rachel Roy Fall/Winter 09 campaign and I was a crumpled mess of tears when I heard that I was one of the four girls chosen for their lookbook. I have never modeled professionally before (I am not signed with an agency but would love the opportunity. I’m just too nervous to approach any ). The RRR experience really was my very first time. I have since done other modeling work for the designer which has also been a huge blessing. Chic Intuition: So we honestly think you are the ONLY person who can pull of snake printed skinnies. How’d you have the guts to go there? Karen: I loved the print and the cut. Plus they were on clearance for $20! Bargain!! Plus anything relatively loud can be counter balanced with an over-sized plain top or a blazer. I have a rocker side to me so I knew I HAD to have those skinnies. The print on them is SICK. I think growing up in London all my life where street style is more experimental than in New York. I am not intimidated by wearing pieces that to others may seem a bit um… challenging? Chic Intuition: If you had to choose: hippie or rocker chic, and why? Karen: Wow. I love both but it’s got to be rocker chic. It just resonates more with me. All the elements, the attitude, not just what is worn but HOW it’s worn. Also the timelessness of it too. It just ‘feels like me.’ I’m at my most comfortable when dressed that way. Hippie comes a close second though..! Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical q time: how studded is too studded? Karen: When it’s worn on more than one piece at the same time. Can you imagine a studded bag with a studded jacket to match? OMG!! As long as it’s one key studded piece worn all by itself and mixed in with the rest of your outfit, then it will always look cool. At least in my books 😉 *Images courtesy of karen-wheredidugetthat.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Some pieces were hot, some were simply not. Although photos haven’t yet been released, the wait for her Autumn/Winter line won’t be that long: 9 days and counting. Till then we’ll safely say: mark your calenders and see what awaits you. From the description below, sounds good. But don’t worry, we promise we won’t sugar-coat our review once the line hits stores and the web! *Image courtesy of topshop.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Why? No idea! We are sure she’s attending the shows. Heck, we even met her at NYFW right before the Oscar de la Renta show! I honestly think it’s the fact that designers are now inviting Tommy Ton, Scott Schuman, and Garance to attend the shows and sit first row giving them less time to take pictures of the attendees on their way out! Please, let the street photogs do their jobs people! We’re dying here! Of the rare shots of Kate Lamphear, these two were my ultimate favourite. Just because each look embodies a totally different persona. On the left we see the soft side of Lanphear in her fuzzy hooded sweater. On the right, we see the fierce side of Lanphear (nicknamed Lanphearce by yours truly) which we all know well and have come to love. Tell us, which one do you prefer, the lion or the lamb? *Images courtesy of elle.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

We can say from the first look that the collaboration stays true to the distinctive Marni style with polkadot prints, amazing necklaces, and flirty silhouettes. For those of you familiar with Marni, their pieces are usually hella expensive so a more reasonably priced option with nothing over $129 is truly a gift from the fashion gods.

The hottest pouts? Nudes. From JLo to LC, the stars have complimented their sun-kissed cheeks with iridescent lipsticks and glosses. Keep in mind, the ladies stay away from looking washed out by emphasizing their eyes with liner or mascara. Personally, we’d recommend adding a swipe of gold/bronze shadow on your lids as well. To get the lipstick look try: NARS Lipgloss in Striptease Stila Convertable Color in Peony Geurlain Kiss Kiss Maxi Shine Lipcolor in Nude Shine *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com .

Did you ever own some sort of a charm growing up, and secretly thought that if you lost it, your life would all of a sudden go bezerk? I used to have this stuffed monkey ( ok still have it ), since I was 2 years old. The damn thing was always around, and when I finally got to the age where it was not cool to sleep with a monkey (no, I will not disclose the embarrassing age), I was so afraid to throw the damn thing away! Kinda felt like it would come back to haunt me from the dead garbage. Well, if you do or don’t believe in lucky charms, we still say that wearing them are so in. In fact, we took the liberty of picking out our fave lucky charms from Max & Chloe .

I remember the first time I laid eyes on this bag, a lady was carrying at a dinner hosted by my great aunt, and I was in awe of its design. First off, I thought the pompous granny had actually stuffed her classic 2.55 Chanel into her Chanel shoulder bag! I kept wondering why in the world she did that (other than the fact that she might have either forgotten to remove a bag, or was being a show off). Hers was the beige+black combo, but after seeing Lindsay’s black on black version, I actually like the bag. Now, before you get excited about ‘2 Chanels for $3500’, the bag only gives the illusion of two bags in one. Like? *Images courtesy of popsugar.com , bagborrowsteal.com and justjared.com .

Well how could you when I didn’t even mention I was going away..I spent my New Years in Delhi with family and friends, and had a blast. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you guys while I was there, I kept a mental list of a post idea for Indian Items. Not necessarily meaning I liked them all ( sandals and socks?

You can see Blair Waldorf donning one of her headbands in almost every episode. But we’re not sure if that will be the case next season. Seems like Behr has chosen to take the dark route for her Fall collection, opting for chains, rhinestones, and studs (a style unknown to preppy lovin’ Waldorf). We love a lot of the bands, but are kind of scared of the fashion faux pas some of them might cause amongst the clumsy of us. I don’t even want to imagine bumping into someone with one of the more spiky headgear. Take a look at the evolution we seemed to notice and decide for yourselves. *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

It was because at that very instant I realized that she was wearing the exact same dress that Ugly Betty was wearing in a recent post ! Is it me or has it been painfully clear that ever since Betty began shooting in New York, her and Blair have been wearing the same pieces? Check out this early pic over the summer where Blair and Betty were wearing the exact same dress (in very different ways of course)… Also, just a thought, can you imagine the look on snobby Blair’s face if she ever runs into Betty wearing something that she also owns???

After months of anticipation, and tons of emails from you guys, we’re happy to inform you that Nicole Richie’s House of Harlow 1960 jewelry line has dropped…a couple of weeks early! You can get your fave pieces on ShopKitson.com . The pieces feature leather, silk strings, chains, rivets, fabric, feathers and gold-plated metals. Most of the pieces out look pretty familiar, I mean Nicole has been running around in LA with them on for a while now. Our faves are the Pyramid Bangles and Black Leather Ring . Nicole’s love for the 60s and 70s is evident in her designs, and we can’t wait to see the rest of the moderately priced collection when it hits stores in November. *Images courtesy of shopkitson.com and justjared.com .

Max Azria managed to set the sexy bar even higher with his latest bandage dress collection; who knew there could be so many alternatives? The braiding/chain detailing screamed power, along with the bold metallics that reflected the strength of each model’s strut. You can’t help but walk with your head high when wearing one of these babies. Believe us, the pictures do them no justice… *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

First off, don’t laugh , I googled ‘Jay Lyon’ to search for a couple of images (ok screen savers), and found some verrrry interesting information. Well, you know how he mentions he just got off a serious 3 year relationship on the show? Guess who Mr Hot Shot was dating? Just some Victoria’s Secret model…..Miranda Kerr! Check out photographic evidence below. Ok now onto second fun fact: Erin’s dad is a band member of AC/DC. And finally, apparently we’ve been unconsciously eying model Allie on a daily basis. No, we don’t stalk her on Facebook people. She’s featured in a banner ad on the side panel of this site! Check her out on the right!! Whoa apparently the cast of this little show gets around huh?

If Marc Jacobs made a ‘Sarah’ bag I would wear it every single day for the rest of my life just to get the chance to tell people it’s name. That’s a big dream for me but for Alexa Chung it’s a reality. The bag that Mulberry named after our favourite British import celebrity is absolutely perfect for her. It blends femininity and masculinity as effortlessly as Chung does herself in her day to day wardrobe choices. Bravo Mulberry and congrats Alexa! *Images courtesy of thefashionspot.com .

My key staples are easy to throw on tops, a hot pair of flats, and jeans. I wouldn’t even dare to wear a dress during the day cuz of the hassle it would involve dressing the look up. Well this photo of Reese Witherspoon really proves that you can take a dress and tone it down to make it an appropriate day look. Notice how she pairs her dress with some low-heeled sandals, sunglasses, and a slouchy bag. Almost instantaneously, her outfit is transformed to day chic and can easily be reverted back to night chic with a hot pair of heels and maybe a black blazer. Double-duty CHICness? I am so IN! *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Danny Roberts , illustrator genius of Igor + Andre , has created a capsule collection for Gwen Stefani’s funky line. The bags portray Danny’s beautiful sketches of ladies donning Harajuku Lover’s designs. I’ve been shamelessly pleading with Mr. Roberts for a sketch of yours truly ( seriously, will you??! ), but settled for his t-shirt with one of my faves “Girls in the Glasses”, until he does, maybe, agree draw me, for which I will parade around town with the image plastered to my head. Freakish? Ya, his drawings are totally worth self-imposed embarrassment. They’re just that amazing. Congrats Danny! Here’s to bigger and better things… If you are interested in the tote or the satchel , you can find them both at Bloomingdale’s. *Images courtesy of igorandandre.blogspot.com .

When your fave pair of jeans is a bit too snug for comfort, you have 2 choices: to loose the pounds ( ha! easier said than done ) or to hide them in the back of your closet (we’re talking about your jeans, not the extra weight). Hold up, we here at Chic Intuition have actually seemed to find another solution, where you can lose the weight on your own time frame ( aka food poisoning ) and keep wearing your fave denim! How you may ask? Well we were browsing one of our fave blogs , remember Carolina who we interviewed a while back, we loved this image of her in these rockin’ leather lined jeans, and a light bulb went off. DIY project! So if you have any pairs of pants that you’d like to make grunge chic, here’s your answer. I’m actually dropping my pair off at the seamstress now (weight gain and laziness come hand in hand with me) ! *Image courtesy of fashionsquad.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Both being avid fans of Nicolas Ghesquière and his signature motorcycle inspired bags, we wondered if Wang could keep Balenciaga in a place of fashion cult-like stardom. The collection shown on the runway was very reflective of Wang’s style and his own signature line. With a black, white, and grey color palette, clean and simple silhouettes, and strategically placed cutouts, the new Balenciaga takes a more minimalistic approach that speaks volumes to a younger crowd. What we especially loved were the structured satchel bags and the out of the box footwear that enhanced the overall look of the ready to wear collection. Only time will tell if Alexander Wang is a good fit for Balenciaga but based on his first attempt, we think it will be a success! *Images courtesy of style.com .

The first is that I watch every episode of The City twice. Why? Well the first time is basically to grasp the drama, events, and ogle Jay. And the second time around I love to just focus on the fashions. You really do notice much more the 2nd time around, like the fact that most of Whitney and Olivia’s wardrobe is from DVF. Now my second, and even more plaguing declaration is that I’ve started to copy a trend I’ve caught Whitney doing: let’s call it the adjacent rings trend. Episode after episode, I found that she loves to wear two rings on her left hand, but unlike most of us out there who’d choose to adorn our index and ring fingers, she wears them on her index and middle finger. Ok, I think this is borderline stalker- ish , but I took the liberty of saving some frame shots for you ladies. I have to admit, once you try it, it’s kind of addictive. Ok, phew, feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Maybe I should confess about finishing the rocky road choco chip cookies to my sisters? Oops, I kind of just did. *Images courtesy of mtv.com . Graphics courteys of Chic Intuition Inc.",

But when Taylor abruptly announces that she is going back to LA in the middle of the trip, you can only imagine the chaos. Has Taylor had it with Team Zoe and her job?

Now although some of you are upset by the fact that we encourage you to get similar versions of high fashion items, we Chics have agreed that as long as it’s backed by reputable brands we support it 100%. We’ll never direct you to a place to get really good fake Guccis or Cuccis (lol), but we’ll always encourage you to look for pieces that are influenced by top designers because it instantly makes them look more expensive. So when the choice is between $120 and $1295 for a pair of studded sandals that will probably be out the next season, we say go for the steal, enjoy them, and throw them away when the trend gets old because we all know how hard it is to throw away Guccis no matter how tired the trend right? *Images courtesy of style.com and their respective links.

Whether we’d end up looking streaked and tweaked or oven-baked burnt, we’ve finally been able to out a bad (or good) bronzer. For beginners, we’d recommend dealing with the powdered type of shimmer. This enables you to highlight the areas of focus, and simultaneously darken your features as you go. Cream bronzers, on the other hand, are quite tricky to maneuver. Most people squeeze the cream on their hands, and apply with fingers or a brush. After a couple of sweeps, they’ll notice that their hands have turned the color of an orange mirangue pie. Don’t forget how sometimes creams can create lines and patches for those bronzer virgins out there! This post was inspired by this image of a flawless Leighton Meester. The fresh faced bronzed beauty clearly knows what works for her, and in this case it’s shine and sheen. Since we don’t know the level of of bronzer application expertise of our Chic Readers, we decided to start out easy with our top 5 powder picks: NARS Blush/Bronzer Duo Guerlain Terracota Bronzing Powder Lancome Star Bronzer Laura Mercier Mosaic Shimmer Block Cargo Beach Blush *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com.

That’s the one plus to a tired trend. We’ve scoured the net for our fave fringed handbags, ranging from the painfully pricey to the cherish-able cheap.

Is it only me, or do you guys also find it wierd that she chose to whip out her YaYa Aflalo Ruffled Garland Top only a wk after Whitney was seen sporting a similar one. It seems to me that ‘someone’ wants to mark her territory as a fashionista and as the original reality show sweetheart. Well Lauren, even if we do fall in love with Whitney’s new show, we promise we’ll still hold a special place in our hearts for The Hills. Now that that’s settled, let’s break down her look: 1. YaYA Aflalo Garland Top 2. Alice and Olivia High Waisted Pants 3. Streets Ahead Studded Belt 4. Mike & Chris Quintus Leather Jacket *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links.

We were so excited to hear that the First Lady was to cover our most coveted magazine, and imagined the endless possibilities of her glammed up. But when we took a look at her in a plain magenta dress, we were a bit disappointed. Havn’t we seen this look and that hair all too much? I don’t know, maybe it’s our mental association with Vogue and all things uber glamorous that got the best of us. What do you think, would you like to have seen her made over? *Image courtesy of Today/MSNBC . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

So far I’ve been quite successful and must say I’m proud of myself. Anyways, while on this mission I happened to check out my local Zara and lo and behold I found the crystal studded Balmain-inspired sandals that no one on the blogosphere is currently able to get. Apparently Zara stopped making them due to a stern warning from Balmain (well that’s the story going around in any case)! Well I’m happy to say I scored the last two pairs they had but unfortunately when I got home they didn’t fit my feet So I was thinking of returning them and then I thought why not help a hopeless fashionista or two out there who didn’t happen to get their hands on their own pair? So here goes, I am selling two pairs of these sandals in a size 40 Eur, 9 USA, and 7 UK. They are both brand new and never worn and one even has a plastic protectant cover on the soles. I must say these babies are very high quality and the studding and crystal detail are not in any way flimsy. After looking up their pricing on Ebay ($450-$599), I’ve listed them here for $350 and free shipping to anywhere in the U.S. (for international a flat rate of $35 with insurance will apply). Good luck!",

Wow we must say we are flattered that you were referred to us to find out the answer to your question. Lucky for you, we did recognize these boots instantly. They are Coach Maxene Leather Boots in Gray and Hadyen Panettiere and Jessica Alba are both huge fans. Hope you are just as enamored by them *Image courtesy of popsugar.com .

If you mix your clothing/accessory items incorrectly, no matter how hot each piece is individually, you might bomb. Take a look at Posh over here, with her black on black overkill. Leather jacket: hot. Aviator shades: hot. Leather bag: hot. But since each bold accessory is harsh on its own, its an easy given that her look won’t go off well. Seems like a nasty mix between Robocop and the Terminator. Not chic. *Images courtesy of justjared.com , mwctoys.com , and stockimg.free.fr . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Keep a close eye on this fashion student, we’re sure she’ll be making her mark on the Fashion World in the near future… Chic Intuition: What drew us to your blog was two things Tala, your undeniable beauty and your nationality. It’s so refreshing (and rare) to see an Arab fashionista run a blog. Tell us how you started. Tala: Thank you! I’m flattered. I have been a fan of blogs for quite a while (a long way before the whole blogging craze begun) I wanted to start my own to share my love for fashion and document my exciting fashion experiences but needed to find the right time for the commitment. Chic Intuition: Anyone who follows My Fash Diary knows that you have your place in the fashion industry. Your mother is the face of Nina Ricci in the Middle East. Do you have any plans to represent a brand in the future? Tala: Never say Never! Chic Intuition: Complete this sentence: “My proudest moment in fashion was….” Tala: “getting assigned a front row seat at Chanel SS11 show in Paris.” Chic Intuition: How surreal was it to meet Christian Louboutin? Did he live up to his God’s gift to women everywhere status?! Tala: He is such an interesting and talented man, and very down to earth! Chic Intuition: Philosophical Q time: How flared is too flared?

His latest presentation entitled Astaire Case or Obstacle Course , was based around feminizing 50s menswear elements. We honestly loved every single piece in this collection. From the color palette to the beautifully sewn light floral detailing, nothing went missing. To top it all off, were the amazing accessories ranging from oxfords to top hats. The extravagant designer took his collection a step ahead of what we’ve grown so tired of seeing, grunge and filth. Thanks Mr. Magic for reminding us that fashion should have some beauty incorporated. *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Even though I look forward to summer, there’s something about winter style that I love. I don’t know what it is exactly but I think it has something to do with the ability to layer, boots, and the fact that winter clothing just looks more elegant. Well today I was at The Grove having dinner and walking around and finally felt the beginning of the winter season. I even ran into Stacy Keibler (umm can I say legs for MILES) and her boyfriend Geoff Stults and they looked like they were also feeling the winter chill. Since I couldn’t snap pics of their street style, I decided to search for some street looks online for the perfect transitional outfits. Check them out below and get inspired people! Warning: These looks are recommended for California winters! For you other guys with snowy weather, make sure to add a few more layers.

Anyways, I am in love with almost every Frye boot, but I don’t want to spend $400. Do you know of any good (cheap) look-a-likes to any of their riding boots? I especially love the Campus 12R in Saddle, but I could totally go for anything :)” Wow, what a fun challenge! We went on the quest for the quintessential look for less, and have to admit that there are a ton of options for not only a $100, but for less than $50! We don’t know if it’s the economy or the fact that designers out there are sympathizing with frugal fashionistas, but we love it either way. Personally we are huge fans of Frye boots, and think that they are a great investment for those of you out there that want a long term relationship with a wearable riding boot. But for those of you seeking a fashionable fling with the trend, then we recommend following Elysia’s lead and looking for a less costly version. We’ve compiled a list of our faves under $100, and have to admit that all this research has got us aching for some cold weather wear!

Her likes? “ White dresses and drawing raindrops “. Ana, a 14 year old residing in the USA, is a teenager oozing individuality, talent, and best of all, intangible realities. Say what you like, her approach to blogging is beyond its time, and we can’t wait to see what she has in store for the future. Read what she had to say and then head on over to her blog, Silver Wings for a taste of the whimsical. Chic Intuition: What attracted us to your blog is the fact that each post is so beautifully composed with images, thoughts,doodles and musings. How did you develop this unique aesthetic? Ana: The mishmash of poems, doodles, musings and photos is just my natural inclination. I want my blog to be a high tech version of a journal, with photos pasted in, poems copied down, and my own musings. Chic Intuition: It’s obvious that you’re an artist, a dreamer at heart. Any future career plans that include fashion and/or art? Ana: I hope to be a photographer or writer. I also want to start my own school and teaching method. Chic Intuition: You quote Frida Kahlo on your blog “ Feet, what do I need you, when I have wings to fly? “. If you could fly, this second, to any destination, where would it be and why? Ana: Holland. I miss my family, the smell of our house, the stores, all of it! Chic Intuition: What is your favorite fashion purchase? Ana: Recently I got this ballet inspired pink skirt from Bloomingdales and I love it. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how dreamy is too dreamy? Ana: Dreamy is never too dreamy as long as its genuine. *Images courtesy of thesearesilverwings.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

No matter how much we drool and swoon over the upcoming pieces from our favourite designers, our only choice at stores these days is the latest from the spring shows of 09. One of the trends I’ve noticed is going to be a big hit this season is the rainbow print dress. Something about these colorful confections feels so fresh (which is what I like to feel during the summers) no? We’ve searched far and wide, more like on Net-a-Porter, to find the best rainbow print dresses out there.

Yes ladies, the time has come where high fashion, high heels, and high prices go down a bit to reach ground level. We’d never thought this day would come, where Mr. Louboutin himself would opt to design sneakers for the girl on the go. At least they don’t look like your typical high tops, we know he was just itching to add some purr fect prints. Here’s the first look at one of his creations via Grazia . And don’t forget to check out Gilt’s Christian Louboutin sale tomorrow!! If you don’t already have an account, sign up here . *Images courtesy of graziadaily.co.uk .

In comparison to Blair’s super preppy and kinda blah outfits, Serena doesn’t cease to wow us with her amazing fashion episode after episode. It could be that the working girl in her was just waiting to shine, or that this season her confidence is sky high. Whatever it is it sure is working! Another hot outfit was her gorgeous green party dress from last night’s episode. Paired with a peacock clutch and a high updo Serena really captures all the reasons why we fell in love with her on the first season. Lucky for us, this piece is available and is the Vena Cava Synthesizer Dress . Tune in next week for more GG fashion updates! xoxo, Chic Critic ( Loves it! ) *Image courtesy of gossipgirlinsider.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

If you are an avid Gossip Girl watcher like myself, you’ll have also noticed this ongoing trend. It seems like this combo is Serena’s latest ensemble of choice and the effect is tres fabulous. You can only imagine how happy I am that I’ve invested in a couple of really cute blazers for this season. If you weren’t quite as lucky, fret not. I searched Net-A-Porter for the chicest blazers and shells out there so you don’t have to. Ready, set, SHOP!

I kinda think it sounds like an insult when someone uses the word “fartsy” in any way, shape or form in a sentence. Well let me try it. Ladies, and gentlemen (you never know), for those of you out there that consider yourself to be artsy fartsy , well then here’s your chance to prove it for the mere price of $1,300. The Fendi ‘Paint-Your-Own’ Baguette is basically a blank canvas that comes with a set of Ten Pantone Universe markers for you to go wild with. Personally I think the idea is great, but kind of nerve wrecking at the same time. One mistake, and you’re stuck with a $1,300 bag that you won’t want to carry. On the other hand, I think that they’re taking the whole “one of a kind” concept to a whole other level, and I love that. I’d create a plan of action, practice a couple of times, and then set my mark on the bag. What do you guys think? *Image courtesy of eluxury.com , and lifeclever.com .

When I offered to throw the party it seemed like an easy feat since my house is already decorated with a Moroccan theme. Lo and behold it was quite a job picking out flowers, table settings, and trying to stay as close to the theme is possible. Even when it came time to building my own Moroccan style low table settings (using unopened banquet tables propped onto coffee tables mind you) I was resilient on making it work using books and what not to provide the much needed balance. All the efforts came to fruition as the party was a smashing success! Even my DIY vase project made with branches, crystals, petite lanterns, and sand was a hit and got a lot of compliments from my friends. Since we know you guys like to get a glimpse of our real chic lives from time to time, I decided to share some pics. Let me know what you think!",

She paired a hard-edged quilted leather mini with a soft knitted sweater for mix and match perfection. We decided to do a little research ourselves on the quilted mini, and were able to find two that ranged from opposite sides of the wallet spectrum. You could try this Balmain version, or go for a little Chadwicks . Either way, just pair it with a soft sweater like our model and out you go! *Images courtesy of elle.com and their respective links.

I always depend on it whenever I’m in fashion chaos. Anyways, I was hoping you could find me a similar and cheaper version of these Miu Miu lace up sandals which retail for $495. And like most people, $495 for a pair of shoes is a bit impossible. So please, if you gals could help me find them, I would be so grateful” Well Hellen you’re in luck, because the moment we saw these sandals, we remembered a pair of eerily similar ones we had seen online! So it was no trouble at all for us to find a cheaper alternative. And we have even better news, on our search for the pair we knew, we found a couple more similar ones on the way! So go ahead and take a look at the Jean-Michel Cazabat Tabatha Sandal or the Cocobelle Cleo-Lace Up Roman Sandal , and finally Pour La Victoire Metallic Naomi Lace Up Flat Sandal . Happy shopping! *Images courtesy of their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

The thing about Gorjana jewelry is that it’s understated in the sense that you always feel like you can pile on her pieces without looking too overdone or like you’re trying too hard… Of course we were so excited when we found out about the exclusive line she’s designed for Shop Bop! Especially since the pieces are very reasonably priced helping with the idea that the more the merrier when it comes to Gorjana’s pieces. Check out our faves and maybe choose a few of your own: 1. Gorjana Halo Bracelet 2. Gorjana Cress Teardrop Necklace 3. Gorjana Turquoise Rory Earrings 4. Gorjana Essex Wrap Necklace 5. Gorjana Bali Open Circle Ring *Images courtesy of their respective links.

We basically collected donations of clothing, jewelry, and home accessories and sold them with all proceeds going to our chosen cause. Even though I was in charge of one of the booths, I made sure to do a lot of shopping myself and for the first time I don’t think my husband minded at all! Anyways, back on topic, I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank Gorjana Jewelry for participating in this event by sending us some of their beautiful pieces as a donation. Funny enough, I ended up buying a piece or two for myself (trust me, they were hard to part with). Even if it wasn’t for charity, I would still have bought some pieces since the new collection is absolutely lovely. Check out some of my faves below",

Whether it was on the male or female models, this ode to the 80s was an obvious inspirational fabric to his less pricey (but still not cheap) Marc by Marc Jacobs line. After skimming through a third of the images, flashbacks of my GAP fall collection post started flying by, and I remembered spotting an eerily similar dress that could pass as an MJ piece. For only $58, a fraction of the designer duds, we say steal away! *Images courtesy of style.com and gap.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Though I personally own the original necklace ( so worth the full price btw ), we know that a couple readers out there won’t or can’t put down that much cash for jewelry. Now, no one can deny the hotness factor of this necklace, proven further more by the oodles of emails we’ve been receiving about finding a much cheaper version of it. So we’ve been hunting down a perfect Cheap Chic version, and we’ve finally found one ! Take a look, and tell us what you think. Just obviously don’t expect it to be as high a quality as the original ( which I still think is worth the investment…why do I feel like I’m cheating on my Paxton necklace!? ). *Images courtesy of their respective links.

She definitely knows how to dress a woman. We were so excited to be there, and we loved the energy of the show. The crowd was feeling the music and clothes, it was all smiles. Here’s a look at the show’s finale. Theme of the night? The graphite drawings of nighttime skies by Vija Celmins’ Hubble Telescope images of lunar floors, and the shattered landscape of the Galapagos islands. Talk about getting back to nature…",

His cardis, tops, and pants are the perfect addition to any fashionista’s wardrobe. Well MANGO has now made it even easier for us all to snag a piece by Adam by getting him to design a limited edition collection exclusively for them. Below are some of my personal favourites and with the price tags ranging from $50 to $260, I’m sure many of you will be equally hooked.

The latest designer to do so? Rachel Roy. She will be designing a diffusion brand exclusive to Macy’s which includes affordable contemporary sportswear, footwear and accessories. The lower-priced line is dubbed Rachel Rachel Roy and is slated to debut in August 2009 . The line will retail from $59 to $299 for sportswear, $79 to $199 for footwear, $40 to $195 for jewelry and $69 to $109 for handbags. Check out a preview of the items below. Seems like Rachel is taking a totally different take with this line, we are just in awe of the jewelry and studded handbags. Founder and artistic director, Rachel Roy, said, “Accessible fashion has always been a passion of mine. Every woman should have the opportunity to express herself through style. Being able to design a contemporary product line that truly reflects a sense of individuality is a great honor. Macy’s has been an embracing partner in helping us launch this redefinition of a new lifestyle collection.” via WWD *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Seems like just yesterday when we were pleasantly surprised by a small Bravo reality show called ‘The Rachel Zoe Project’. Our love for Rachel grew, we got some insight into the hectic life she lives, and kind of understood her. Her assistants are just divine, and have a major role luring in the viewers week to week. So we bid adieu to one of our fave tv pleasures. Take a sneek peak at the last episode (airing this Tuesday and 9/10c): “Oscar week is the busiest time of year for Rachel Zoe, and all emotions are running high. Taylor finally breaks and gives Rachel an ultimatum. She gets a third assistant to do Brad’s job so Brad can continue to be Rachel’s gal pal.”",

It will be a great distraction from work tomorrrow when im bored I was wondering where i could find a suit/boyfriend blazer jacket for under 100 dollars! I would love if it was available to buy over the net as I’m from the UK! I’m also very petite so would need a really small fitting one around the arms especially!! Hope to hear back from you soon! “ Hey Debbie! We love it when we find out that we have international fans! Especially from somewhere as stylish as the UK. We were able to fulfill your request and find a few boyfriend blazers at under $100. If you feel some are too oversized, I would actually suggest wearing them as a dress. Check out a few of our finds below. Hope this helps! Clockwise from top:",

Yes, we Wiki-ed it for you and aren’t ashamed. So why are we encouraging the trend? Because we’d rather you don a bow than a scrunchie ( damn you Marc J for bringing them back! We still love you though ). You have to admit, if more than 3 fashion houses show a certain trend, you know it’ll be around. Our personal recommendation to take it from Runway to Realway? Minimize the size down a couple of notches. Try this headband for starters. Just don’t go the LV way and pair it with an oversized afro. *Images courtesy of style.com .

They are these black things that cross in their neck, usually with dress shirts, [and] have a pin in the middle. I’m dying to get these! Please help!” Those ‘things’ are cute! Basically they are silk cross neckties with small pins in the middle, that hold them onto the blouses the girls wear. Reminds us of what Girl Scouts wear. Blair is probably the character that dons them the most with her uniforms. We actually found some eerily similar ties here and here , they’re from a girl’s school uniform online shop! *Images courtesy of cwtv.com and their respective links.

I don’t know, but does anyone else think that they are stooping too low by adhering to the public’s hunger for reality tv? I cringed when I heard that they would be releasing a 14 episode online series… following the lives of models. Cringe further . My fave quote? “ …but I was also like, you know, I’ll go to 4 years of university but, you know I’m like what am I gonna do with my degree? “. I don’t know, maybe have something to fall upon if this whole “reality show” thing doesn’t work? These girls already have representation, so it’s basically a documentary of their introduction into the fashion week world. I found it kind of blah boring. Why not make a documentary on girls struggling to get a deal while balancing numerous jobs to support themselves in major cities? Now that’s reality tv. Check out the first episode below and decide whether you like it or not.",

So far only a few pieces are available online but we’re sure more will eventually trickle in. The pieces are very reminiscent of the clean cut elegance of Roy’s original line but the price tag per piece is a lot less hefty! I’m especially loving the jumpsuit and the chain layered top.

Ok so it’s not actually day 1 of the fashion week, but we missed the first two because of that crazy blizzard. So basically this is our first day. I’m blogging from the comfort of my tiny desk here at my hotel a few blocks away from the tents at Bryant Park with a huge case of sore feet. We thought we’d share our experience with you guys, in hopes that you feel that you attended as well. After all, it’s because of our readers that we have this great opportunity. *Photos and graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition, LLC.",

The reason I asked was actually quite selfish. I’m thinking that I’M a suffering Shop-a-holic. “ Why? ” might you ask? Well, simply put it hasn’t been 2 weeks since I purchased my gray Rocco , and now I’m lusting over this leopard beauty. I blame Chris . Her pics were too lustworthy. Help. Me. If you’ve been hit by Wang fever, than you can purchase it here if you’re in the States and here internationally for about $950. *Image courtesy of christeric.blogspot.com .

I bought this outfit (that I consider to be uber hot) shortly after thanksgiving and wore it a week or two ago. One of the things that I find really interesting is that by pairing high-end and low-end pieces together, you really do fool people into thinking that your $15 cuffs are by some hot designer. Check it out and tell me what you guys think. Hot? OR Not?",

So today I decided to head to the mall with a few friends to try and get my fashion fix. Lo and behold I stumbled on these beauties and honestly I was flabbergasted! Not only do they look amazingly edgy, they are extremely comfortable and easy to walk in and affordable at a little over $100! Daymn! I even convinced them to give me a 25% discount!!! Oh the power of a desperate fashionista’s persuasion… Anyways I’m in love and came home on a shopping high and I highly recommend that you ALL go for a pair of your own. Buy them here .",

Because she’s wearing the Phillip Lim top that we posted about yesterday, TODAY. It’s pretty clear she was looking for a good bargain under $200 and as soon as she saw our choices , fell in love with this top and had her stylist bring it to her asap! She also couldn’t wait to show off her new buy and wore it immediately. Do you think she’s trying to tell us that she’s reading our blog? Anyways, not to sound too desperate, we’re just kidding of course! But what more proof do you need that it’s a hot piece than when a stylish celeb like Rachel takes it out for a spin? It also helps that it’s highly affordable at $175 and for Phillip Lim that ain’t half bad! If you still haven’t, get yours here . *Image courtesy of popsugar.com .

Mobiles are actually considered accessories to most outfits, and some people actually go the next step and personalize theirs with studs, covers, and tassels. And since we here at Chic Intuition are constantly discussing what’s hot and what’s not, we had to include something for you tech ies out there. Celebrities have been loving Blackberries since they first popped up, and it looks like this fashionable phone isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

The impeccable Karl Lagerfield presented them at Chanel amongst a sea of black and navy clothing. What we love about tights is the fact that they add dimension to an outfit, and the best part is that they probably cost you the least. Take a look at the lace tights we chose above, worthy of complimenting any winter wardrobe. Happy Shopping! *Images courtesy of style.com and freepeople.com.

It’s only shown a couple times and I couldn’t get an extremely good look at it. I Googled to see if I’d be able to find anything online, but to no avail! It looks vintage-y, and looks like it’s onyx, both of which I LOVE. If you could find it I’d be forever grateful!” Ok so let’s be honest: we could not get a good look at the ring! You’ve really hit us with a toughie Kacia! But we love challenges, so we found the only image of Zoey donning the ring, zoomed it in to pixallated oblivion and tried our best to figure out how it looked (we havn’t seen the movie). We found this vintage inspired onyx ring by CC Skye . Pretty similar, no? Hope you like it and Happy shopping! *Images courtesy of wb.com and my-wardrobe.com.

Although Donatella has spoken publicly about her reasons not to do a diffusion line in the past, it seems that she’s finally come around… The collection will feature pieces with special touches that embody the iconic label’s design aesthetic and will be available November 19, 2011. Donatella was so excited about the pieces that she actually wore the leather studded dress when presenting the real Versace collection in Milan. Can’t wait to see what else they have in store and if the shoes the models are donning are included, I will definitely be lined up from the week before! *Images courtesy of huffingtonpost.com .

However, I was happy to discover that it was a Kate Moss for Topshop piece. Why? Ummm… because I can actually afford it! If you are just as enamored, click here .

You dream about wearing it and going out in it. The dreams are endless, until you finally buy it. It’s in your hands, you feel fulfilled.

One part of a heel-obsessed duo, I find it very surprising to see her in her chic black ensemble and a pair of sneakers. Not only sneakers, but clunkers (sorry Ash!)! Well, you gotta hand it to her. The look on her face proves that she thinks she absolutely got it right. Elizabeth and James, The Row, Influences… With that much on your plate I guess you gotta drop the ball once or twice right? *Image courtesy of justjared.com .

Rosena Sammi ‘s jewelry is truly a unique, elegant approach to fine accessories. She started her career path on a rather different note, as an attorney in New York. Her passion for jewelry shone through, and she decided to pursue her dream by attending the Parsons School of Design. Apparently not only do we here at Chic Intuition admire her collections, but so do the stars. Her designs have been donned by the likes of Hillary Duff, Claire Danes, and Naomi Watts. Take a look at some necklaces from her meaningful Kismat Collection , with prices ranging from $110-$230. *Images courtesy of rosenasammi.com and 4to40.com .

Chic Intuition has teamed up with Chick Downtown for a Current Elliot Jeans giveaway! This time we are planning on doing things a little differently. Instead of picking a winner at random, we decided to choose him/her based on their ability to style. Head over to Chick Downtown and check out the Current Elliot Jeans styles they have available, and leave a comment below with a valid email address (will not be published) explaining with images or links how you’d style your pair of choice. Examples include with a chic blazer or even with some Rachel Leigh Jewelry . Make sure to use items only from Chick Downtown. Only one winner will be chosen at the end of the giveaway. One entry per person . This contest ends Monday, July 20th at 7PM EST. U.S. residents only. Good luck! P.S.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I love jewelry, it’s just that I’m always running late, so decisiveness is a luxury. That’s why I decided to invest in a couple of gold+diamond bracelets that I don’t have to take off. They literally live with me, and are comfortable enough to sleep in.

For a little while by now I have been wanting to redecorate my bedroom but haven’t decided what direction to take. I was wondering if you could give me a hand with some stylish advice and ideas of how a stylish bedroom in your opinion should look. The only thing I have decided is the colors which are hot pink and aqua so maybe you can start with that.” Ooh, I love a good decorating question! We’re always discussing how we feel fashion and design go hand in hand, so here’s our chance to prove it. The great coincidence is that I’m personally in the process of redecorating, and my two colors are quite similar to yours Maria (light turquoise and magenta). So let’s get started with a few tips: Ok Maria, for your room we thought we’d go eclectic chic. We created a color map that we followed, and chose items based on the mix we talked about above. Enjoy!

Well that happened to me today. I was going to a wedding three weeks ago and I really wanted to wear a long-sleeved maxi dress to go with a vintagey look. Well, at the time, I couldn’t find a single one that I liked and today I find one almost instantaneously while trying to recreate this hot look donned by Cate Blanchett. She was out celebrating the 50th anniversary for Vogue and damn she looked good! I tried to find a red hot dress but was unsuccessful and so I decided to go for the general chicness of her look with the T-Bags Drape Sleeve Long Dress , Michael Antonio Women’s Sawyer Platform Sandals , and the Rachel Leigh Jewelry Cleo Teardrop Collar Necklace .

I absolutely love your blog, so when I stumbled on this problem I had only you to turn to. I’m desperately in love with this McQ sweater Gwen Stefani wore on the October 2009 cover of Glamour, and I’m dying for a more affordable version. I would be so appreciative of any ideas! “ Hi Callie! Thanks for the amazing compliments. The sweater is so FAB that we must applaud your choice. Our advice on this would be either to wait for the original McQ one to go on sale or you can opt for a similar look with this Pointelle Marilyn Tunic in a larger size than you usually wear to give it the same baggyness of the original. Either way, a hot pink oversized sweater is definitely a must-have for those drab winter days. *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

We were working on our own list, and had to admit that we matched 4/5 of their choices! Guess they made it that much easier for us, and boy did we need a break. So taking off on where they started, here are our top picks for each trend. We say, try your best to have at least one from three of the categories to work with. We can’t express how much shoes make the outfit, so Happy Shopping!

Sounds perfect, no? I mean, they’re actually the most sold brand of jeans at Nordstrom , so that must mean they do the job. Prices are pretty reasonable around the $100 mark, and some models are even on sale. Check em out here . *Images courtesy of their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Not only is she a model and an exquisite beauty, she is also the greatest multitasker in the history of fashion! She is a Norwegian MTV VJ, a street style photographer, a blogger , a makeup artist, hairstylist, and a fashion stylist. Phew! Didn’t think I’d get through that list! Anyways, we have been mesmerized by images of this girl all across fashion weeks this season and couldn’t help but notice her amazing fashion sense. What’s nice is that she dons affordable pieces by Jeffrey Campbell and Zara with the more high-end Wang ones. Check this girl out and prepare to be hooked. Just don’t tell us we didn’t warn you! *Images courtesy of elle.com , jakandjil.com , and hanneli.com",

You can never go wrong with a simple jeans + tee combo (but you might want to try straight fit jeans instead of skinnies if your flight is longer than 2 hours). She added flare to the simple outfit with the Kettle Black boots we’ve mentioned a while back and cute weekender bags . *Images courtesy of popsugar.com and their respective links.

Well the more accessible See by Chloe sister line of course! They always manage to come out with the sweetest of all dresses, especially handy for those lazy summer days. I remember eying this Floral Summer Dress for a while on Net-a-Porter . It went on sale, and then went poof , into the hands of a lucky fashionista.

I mean, can the woman do any wrong? We guess not. Take a look at her here, she manages to pull off the subtly stained lips and barely there blush without a hitch. We’d recommend trying this look for a sweet change from the harsh winter makeup wear. Start off by generously applying Givenchy Prism Foundation to the face and neck area. With the tip of your ring finger, slowly smoothe Benefit Cosmetics Boi-ing Concealer under and around the eye area. With the same finger, dab on the foundation over your eyelid from crease to brow line. Use a round-tip eyeliner brush to sweep Bare Escentuals bareMinerals Liner Shadow along the upper and lower lashlines. Blend. Apply Givenchy Phenomen’Eyes Mascara to upper and lower lashes. Repeat numerous times till lashes have reached required thickness. Dab on Tarte Natural Beauty Cheek Stain on to the apples of your cheeks. Finish off the look by swiping Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Lipbalm and then blotting with a tissue. Voila! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Thanks so much!” We have to admit, it wasn’t hard finding the source of the bracelet, the hard part was getting a good view of it on Kelly’s hand! But don’t worry Maryann, everything is A-okay now. The bracelet is called the ‘Evil Eye’ and is by London Jewelers . It goes for $675 or $875 depending on size. Steep huh? We thought you might say so. Therefore we went ahead and found a great alternative ( also made of real diamonds ) here for less than half the price.

I especially love Serena Van Der Woodsen’s fashion sense. Do you have any idea who designed this dress that she is wearing while filming in the Hamptons?” Hey GG Forever! We could have easily guessed from your nickname that you are a Gossip Girl Fan. Well guess what? We are too! The fashion on that show is to DIE for. Anyways, lucky for you we actually have an idea about the dress Serena is wearing. It’s designed by Blumarine but for some reason isn’t available online. Check out the wrap dress version here . Otherwise try Bloomingdales- they have the exact same one. Good luck *Images courtesy of nordstrom.com and justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I only hope President Obama turns out to be everything he promises. Otherwise, it’s gonna be a BIG disappointment.

I even went to the level of creating a Cheap Chic post dedicated to the beauties and a much less pricey version, just to nudge the whole blogosphere into purchasing them! Chic Critic cringes at the mere idea of trying them on, and I on the other hand, whine and whimper for her to give them a chance. A few days ago I ask my brother, who lives in the States, to order them online for me, and he actually used the adjective “gross” to describe them. I can’t give my final say on the sunnies till they arrive in the mail, but based on other fashionable females, I think they look just fine. Gross? I think not. *Images courtesy of stureplan.se , thatshot.blogg.se , and fatale.se/author/natalie . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

We love how she upped the trendy factor by wearing a brightly colored mini. This outfit could have taken a very wrong turn if she had worn a black or white skirt ( hellooo Office Chic). Rachel seems to love adding blazers to her outfits these days, which we have been doing ourselves. The thing about a fitted jacket is that it adds form to an otherwise loose-fitting apparel. And we all know that form is code for “thinner looking”.

But do you know where she got her dangling bracelet (that she wears on her wrist next to her gold watch)??? I’ve been searching and searching for that bracelet! I believe its the same one Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, and Nicole Richie have all worn before. Please let me know if you find out!!! Thank you!” Well Sally, we tried squinting and focusing on shots of Taylor from the show (sorry there weren’t any close-ups) but we couldn’t ID it. The good news is that we found similar bracelets, like the 14K Gold-Filled Rope Bracelet by Beth Lauren. It’s 50 inches long, so it can be worn as a necklace too! The bracelet retails for $170, and you can find it here . We are also loving the Jorge Morales Fringe bracelet that you can see here .

                            "post_text_content": "November 10, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview Let’s go on a fab trip Down Under, and visit our latest interviewee, 20 year old Ashleigh. Hailing from Melbourne, this blogger has perfected ‘casual chic’. She’s even credited with coining the term ‘ Wangster ‘ (aka girls who dress in Alexander Wang type outfits). Think a t-shirt + shorts combo is bland? Well you haven’t seen anything till you’ve seen her donning them. The fact that she adds flare to any outfit is what compels us to visit her blog continuously. Take a look at what she had to say. Chic Intuition: We love how the seasons in Melbourne, Australia happen almost at opposite times than the rest of the world. So when we’re snuggling up for winter, you guys are prancing around in your summer clothes. Do you love/hate that? And does it affect your outfit choices? Ashleigh: It is a love-hate relationship. I see what everyone is wearing overseas in the Summer and I start getting inspired and excited about all the wonderful things to wear, but then Fall rolls around and I am completely envious of all the leather, fringing and grunge. I love the fact that I can prepare extra early from the inspiration that I get from all the other bloggers, runways and magazines, but I do hate it because I haven’t found many bloggers in Australia that I can be inspired by for our seasons and relate to in style. I’m really trying to drag out some warmer clothes for as long as possible, for example I just bought the American Apparel lame leggings and we’re almost in Summer weather! Chic Intuition: You study media and communication. Any goals of heading into the fashion realm in the future with your degree? Ashleigh: My course at the moment is a three year course, I’m almost one year down and I have been looking into doing a fashion course afterwards. I’m just not sure where to look or what to do I would love to be a fashion journalist or a stylist. I really want to stay in the fashion realm in some way or another. Chic Intuition: What’s your fave purchase and why? Ashleigh: It’s such an overdone answer but my leather jacket. I don’t even think twice about grabbing it! I think it comes everywhere with me. I bought it earlier this year and I seriously thank myself for buying it everytime I pull it out. It goes with everything! And it certainly toughens up the girlier elements of my wardrobe. Chic Intuition: Hermes Birkin or Chanel 2.55? Ashleigh: Chanel 2.55. I annoy the hell out of my boyfriend about this bag. I think it’s perfectly classic, timeless and completely versatile. It’s just an absolutely beautiful bag. Okay I think I’ve gushed way too much. Chic Intuition: Your blog not only reflects your fashion choices, but you talk about some aspects of your personal life as well. When do you draw the line on what to talk about? Ashleigh: I really enjoy knowing something about the person I’m reading about whether it be on blogs, in magazines or anything. I don’t reveal a whole lot more than just day to day events, such as if I bought something new or what I did during the day. I think it’s nice to be a little personal, it’s more natural, I mean, it is a personal blog aswell as a fashion diary, and this way I don’t appear like a clothes horse robot. Chic Intuition: If you could choose any piece from a designer this season, what would it be? Ashleigh: Well now that Australia is coming into Summer that’s really tough because I would love to buy all the wonderfully warm clothes but that would be a waste for another season. I would really like to keep some rock and roll for Summer so I think I’d have to go with Balmain’s studded sandals. I’d die for them. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical q: How ripped is too ripped? Ashleigh: Nothing can ever be too ripped. *Images courtesy of iamashleigh.blogspot.com .

Even what looks like a simple pair of jeans can often look better on a celebrity than it would on just anybody. A lot of this is simply star power, and the perceptions we have of celebrities as beautiful people; but one way to help yourself to look as attractive and stylish as the celebrities you admire is to invest in designer clothing. Acne is one example of a very popular and very stylish clothing brand that provides high-end version of basic clothing and styles. Having originated not all that long ago in Sweden, Acne has enjoyed a steady rise in recognition and respect in the world of fashion, and is reliable for producing attractive clothing options. Plus, if you shop online, it is not uncommon to find extremely appealing sales and discounts that make this clothing available at pretty incredible prices.",

The ability to design jackets that cost over $5000 and sell out at Net-A-Porter in mere seconds is reason enough to admire this man. In keeping with his reputation, the Balmain Spring 2010 collection did not disappoint! The theme, as always, was extreme shoulders and military details along with liquid gold dreses and silver sequin pants. The result? A breathtaking feast for the eyes and an array of outfits that each of us will pine for but will mostly probably end up purchasing a similarly inspired piece from a more affordable line… On the bright side, at least Balmain has the influence to make that possible *Images courtesy of style.com .

Doesn’t seem like much of a departure from her previous collections, so we’re sure you can guess that you can expect some vintage patterns, bohemian cuts, body con dresses, shorts, and lingerie. If you’d like to check it out then head on over to Topshop.com ASAP, since we predict Ms Moss’ brand lures in the millions. *Images courtesy of topshop.com .

Just yesterday Chic Critic and I were discussing how there is hardly any venue out there with fashionable maternity clothing. Why is that? Honestly, we couldn’t think of a legit excuse. My fellow co-editor actually mentioned that she’d love to see a pregnant woman donning some cool skinnies and a bf blazer. Wow hon, I’m kinda wishing that you asked for a million bucks. Because, lo and behold, Mrs. Freddie Prinze, Jr was seen out shopping just this morning in the exact outfit you mentioned, unborn baby in tow. I wish I’d look that good 8 months along. Chicas, look out for the Chic Intuition Maternity Line soon!! ( we wish ). *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Just keep in mind, this version of the smokey eye should only be worn out at night, or else people might claim you have another type of eyes, raccoon! Start off by covering your whole eyelid with a pressed powder base in a color that matches your skin tone. With a large eyeshadow brush, swipe black eyeshadow over your whole eyelid. As you’re applying, make sure to move the brush back and forth (see the pink lines on the eye graphic). Take a medium sized brush, and rotate black shadow within the inner corner of your eye. Allow your hand to move freely, and it’s encouraged that your shadow not be limited to just your lid, but outside the crease as well. Using a tilted liner brush, swipe the shadow upwards and out at the outer corners of your eyes. Look in the mirror….wink, and go! *Images courtesy of latahvalley.org and justjared.com .

                            "post_text_content": "August 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview If you, like us, have been enamored with Catt Saddler and Debbie Matenopoulos’ style on E!’s Daily 10 from day one, meet the woman responsible. Not only is Monica Rose the brain behind this duo’s amazing style, she’s also the force who managed to single-handedly put Kim Kardashian on the map as a new fashion icon. While the internet is infested with wannabe stylist bloggeristas galore, Monica is an established stylist who decided to start her own blog. The result? A 24/7 stylist at your fingertips with one click of a mouse! Her site is a mix of cheap chic picks, inspirational fashion shoots, and breakdowns of her clients’ outfits. One look and we were hooked and we’re sure you will be too. Think of it this way, what better place to get fashion advice than from a celebrity-trusted source? Check out our interview with Monica Rose below then make sure to head on over to her website for your own personal style session. Chic Intuition: Let’s get the most obvious question out of the way, for the aspiring stylists out there, tell us what it takes to break into the Hollywood Industry? Also, what is the difference between someone stylish and a Stylist? Monica: It’s about being reliable, following through, staying committed – not only to your obligations but to your clients and maintaining positive relationships with showrooms, designers,tailors, etc. Also, appreciating the people behind the scenes who actually make everything I do style-wise possible is key! I think that the best way to break into the Hollywood side of this industry is to be well rounded, follow through, have patience and never give up! Being young and hungry really shows in your work and people take notice and will want use you all the time in this industry. I remember I would work 15 hours days straight and not complain once just do my job. I was not even getting paid anything but I knew it would pay off in the long run. Styling is no joke it’s not all Glitz and Glamour like people think it is. In regard to the difference between someone stylish and a stylist is that a stylist is in tune with what their clients needs and they don’t dress their clients like they would their own self. Yes, of course I have my influence when it comes to trends but as a stylist I have to remember that my clients have their own body types, and that it’s most important to dress them in what makes them comfortable and feel fabulous. A stylish person knows their body to a T and takes risks with their own image which is awesome! I love seeing so many stylish people out and about. It inspires me! Chic Intuition: I have this little mind game I play with my mom. I count how many times she literally stops in her tracks every time E!’s Daily 10 is on, and stares at the ladies’ wardrobes. What do you think makes their style so appealing to women of all ages? Monica: Debbie and Catt are amazing to work with. They both have very different styles. My goal everyday is to make sure my talent feels great and confident in front of the camera! They love being fashion forward and are open to any new idea I may have. I think women can relate to Debbie and Catt’s style because they own their look, I make sure the wardrobe I select works with their body types and nothing is forced! It all comes very naturally. Chic Intuition: In addition to your TV gig, you dress one of the red carpet’s style mavens: Kim Kardashian. Is there a difference between styling for TV and for the red carpet? Monica: There is a big difference but they are equally challenging! TV is so different because there are camera rules and it is very challenging to work around them. Especially with moraying, making sure things read properly , etc. I recreate all the wardrobe to fit the ladies for the show which takes a lot of time pinning to make sure it fits perfect for television. Its more work than you would think. Also, I dress them for 5 shows a week plus field shoots so always having a full wardrobe is a major challenge. Kim is amazing to work with and she LOVES to take fashion risks! There is more on the line when it comes to red carpet events so it is challenging finding the perfect ensemble and easier because I don’t have to worry about camera rules. There are other factors to tie into red carpet/event styling like making sure the outfit is functional, photographs well and that the hair and makeup is in sync with her look. It’s a team effort! Chic Intuition: Because Celebs are very public figures, it’s hard not to view what they wear as a reflection of their individual style. We, however, know that it takes a team to make them look that good. Have you ever had to transform a style dud into a style maven? Monica: I can say that there is no such thing as a style dud, just people who need direction as it is a challenge for most people to stick with what works for THEM! When I started working with my client Khloe Kardashian, we literally went through her closet and got rid of SO many things! She was freaking out! It was time for a change. She had great clothes but she was shopping for what she liked and not what was right for her. So now she has a sexy, sleek style with very simple but definitive direction. And I think she looks fab and really made her style her own! I live for makeovers! It’s my thing. Chic Intuition: Do you think stylists don’t get enough credit for the work they do? Monica: I never really think about feeling credited or being recognized. I’m happy with a simple thank you or a smile on my clients face when we find the perfect outfit. I don’t need validation because I am happy with my work. Just looking back on where I was 5 years ago and the challenges I faced that got me where I am now is all the credit I need! Chic Intuition: Leggings, throw them in the trash or keep them in your stash? Monica: Keep them! I love leggings, they are so easy and effortless when done right. Chic Intuition: Truth be told, a ton of girls aim at investing in a Hermes Birkin. Do you think that should be the goal of a 20 something, or should she aim at something more accessable like a quilted Chanel? Monica: I don’t believe in going outside your means for any piece, so I would recommend working with your budget. If you can afford the Hermes Birkin then go for it! It’s a classic! I would personally go for the Chanel in a basic color so it will work with your wardrobe. Chic Intuition: Your blog is absolutely amazing. We love the fact that you always post stylish bargains. What are your favorite stores for hot bargain shopping? Monica: I love H&M, Topshop and Zara. I am also into thrifting and I get a lot of inspiration from vintage pieces. I love going downtown to the Fashion District. I find a lot of great affordable pieces down there too. I have my hidden spots! Chic Intuition: You’re standing in front of your closet, scouring through the hangers and can’t find anything to wear (been there, done that, huh?). What would be the easiest/safest thing to wear for a dinner out with friends? Monica: If all else fails I always fall back on my favorite skinny jeans, a great tank top and a pair of flat sandals. If the girls decide to make it a night out, I put on a pair of heels and a blazer and the transition from dinner to dancing is complete! It’s always safe to bring a pair of heels out for those just in case situations. Chic Intuition: Since you are a stylist, we have to take advantage and ask, what are this season’s top 5 style musts? Monica: I love this question! 1. Studs – boots, gloves, tights, jackets. Anything studded! 2. Gloves – Gloves are going to be HUGE this fall! 3. Animal print – HUGE for fall as well! 4. Structured pieces – Detailing, shoulder pads. Anything with shape. 5. Oversized or Exaggerated accessories – A MUST HAVE! Chic Intuition: We find it so intriguing that you decided to take to the internet and start your own blog. We must ask, what are three of your favorite fashion blogs? Monica: There are so many great ones! But I would have to say my top 3 sites I start my mornings with are fashionindie.com , becauseimaddicted.net , fashioncopious.typepad.com . Chic Intuition: Last, but not least, a philosophical question: how much black is too much black? Monica: Have you seen my blog! I always pull so much black wardrobe for my clients. I think black is very chic and it more slimming too. Every girl needs a black basic skirt, dress, pant and blazer in their closet. You can base your entire wardrobe for a week around those key pieces. There is no such thing as too much black! *Images courtesy of monicarosestylist.blogspot.com and flisted.com.

Lara Stone, born to a Dutch mother and an English father, was actually ‘discovered’ at the ripe age of 12. She signed onto Elite Model Agency at the age of 15, but her career didn’t flourish until she switched to IMG in 2006. What we love about this girl is her chameleon affect. She can pull off any look, with full confidence and swagger. Fun fact? She’s known for her wobbly runway walk, attributed not to her own talent, but the fact that she has quite small feet for her height (a size 7 in a size 9-10 world). In the February 2009 edition of Vogue Paris, which featured Stone on the cover and sole model in the magazine, she said she does not like the runway; that her unusually small feet for a person her size do not fit in shoes, and she often thinks, “Do not fall, do not fall.” Take a closer look at this gap toothed beauty who proves that different is special. *Images courtesy of style.com .

With the holidays so near and the budgets slowly dwindling away, we decided to search Delias for a range of affordable and supercute holiday skirts. Can’t get it in time for Christmas?

The collection seems to be very Navajo inspired and I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. I feel that moccasins are a bit been there done that but I do love the Baron flat and the Pearl open toe pumps. Tell us, what do you think of the House of Harlow shoe line? Clockwise from top left:",

It served as the better than bland place to shop for basics….that’s about it. But now, we have to admit that with Patrick Robinson leading the design pack things have taken a turn for the better. Stores and their online shop are slowly releasing items from the Fall collection, and we are impressed. The fitted blazers, men’s flannel shirts (bought myself a couple), and tasseled scarves utter Parisian chic sweet-nothings. Fall into the Gap?

                            "post_text_content": "November 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview This time we decided to do something a little different. Instead of going the usual path of interviewing a fashion blogger, we decided to interview a blogger with a fashionable side to her. Ev´Yan Nasman hails from Pasadena, California, and unlike most bloggeristas, is married and to a hot vegetarian nonetheless! Apricot Tea is best described as Ev’Yan’s personal diary because she cover all things in her life, not just fashion, making her blog an interesting read. This girl has mad writing skills, if I do say so myself, and her blog is simply addictive. Check it out and prepare to be wrapped up in the world that is Apricot Tea… Chic Intuition: Okay let’s start with the cliche question, what got you into blogging? Ev’Yan: I actually started in 2002, when the term “blog” was pretty much nonexistent. My blog at the time wasn’t very public, not very many people knew that I had one, and it was very anonymous. I closed it down directly after a horrendous breakup with an ex and never thought that I would make another one. But several years later, I had this urge to compose, and share, and have my own unique space on the internet. I talked to my boyfriend (now my husband) and asked him to create and design a blog for me. Within a few weeks, Apricot Tea was up and running. Chic Intuition: What we thought was unique about your blog is that, mixed in with the fashion, you also take reader questions and give them personal advice . What made you decide to do so? Ev’Yan: Since starting Apricot Tea, I would get a lot of emails from readers randomly asking me for fashion & beauty advice. I found that so flattering and thought it would be great if I could have a blog dedicated to my readers & their questions, no matter how big or small. I soon discovered that there weren’t many advice blogs around the blogosphere, and the ones that did exist, were run by an older generation. The best way to put it, I think, was that I wanted it to be an Ask Abby for 20-somethings. Ask Apricot is still flourishing in its own way, & it doesn’t have the amount of success that Apricot Tea has. But I’m proud of it, nonetheless. Chic Intuition: How would you describe your personal style? Ev’Yan: My style is always evolving; it really depends on my mood. It can be light on some days and heavy on others (both literally and figuratively). I take inspiration from men’s styles and the music I listen to. I don’t even know if there’s an accurate word for it. My style is just my own. No matter what I wear, though, I always dress for comfort. Always. Chic Intuition: One of the things that makes you stand out is your cute pixie cut. How did you get the courage to chop of your locks? And did your mom freak out (we know ours would…)? Ev’Yan: For the latter question: No… my mother did not freak out (haha!). She was actually quite proud, I think, that I was willing to cut off all my hair without remorse. At the time, my hair was shoulder length and I hated it. I felt like it was weighing me down, physically & emotionally. One day, I was looking at magazines to get inspiration, and I saw this black model with a funky mohawk, and I was like, “That is what I want.” I remember taking the picture to my hairstylist (who was also my neighbor) and she was really, really hesitant to cut it that short. She kept asking me, “Are you sure? Are you sure?” And I was firm with my answer. That was about 5 years ago, and since then, I have never had my hair long. I’m pretty sure I’ll have a short crop all my life. It’s so much easier to manage. My next version of a pixie cut will most likely be a buzzed head. I’ve been wanting to do it for years. I’m just waiting for the right moment! C hic Intuition: We noticed that you are married and to a super cute guy FYI. What did you wear on your wedding day? Did you go for the traditional or did you add a little of your unique edge? Ev’yan: Since it was spontaneous (we eloped to Vegas), I didn’t have a real wedding dress. But I did have a white sun-dress that I loved, so I wore that. Since it was in the middle of December (Christmas, to be exact!), I wore black skinny jeans with the dress. Jonathan, my husband, wore a white button-up shirt, with skinny black jeans, annd black Chucks. We looked very put together, but our personal styles still shown through. I guess it’s safe to say that I added my own unique edge. Chic Intuition: Lastly, a philosophical question, how personal is too personal? Ev’Yan: If you’re a friend of mine, nothing is too personal. Nothing.",

The new age style is the practical mini bag, big enough to carry your essentials (key’s, wallet etc) and yet small enough to stay out of your and other people’s way. While browsing shopbop.com I couldn’t help but notice how cute their mini bag selection was. Another advantage I noticed, the price on a mini bag is so much smaller than that on a large IT bag if you know what I mean. Check out our picks below or head over and choose your own. Either way, a mini bag is now a must!",

It seems like after every episode I go on a search frenzy looking for a beautiful piece that was worn by Blair and not Serena! I don’t know what it is, but maybe Blair bribed GG Stylist Eric Daman to give her the hotter outfits this season? Sounds like something she would do… Anyways, this week another episode and another gorgeous Blair look. This time it was the colorblocked sensation Alice + Olivia Jabot Dress that made a splash in my opinion. Keep dressing like that B and by the end of the season we’ll all be saying “S who???” xoxo Chic Critic (I just had to add that!)",

Her 14 bag collection , inspired by her love of vintage, has a moderate price range of $43 to $323. We applaud her for being one of the few celebs which aim to please the mass market. But, unfortunately the low prices seem to unsurprisingly lead to a low quality collection. We haven’t had the chance to see the bags up close, so we don’t mean fabric/leather quality. We merely feel that the designs could have gone a more innovative way. We felt that déjà vu “been there done that” when looking at the range. Take, for example, the logo of her line. It’s a clover with hearts in the middle. Really? A clover Mischa? How unique of you. It really does stand out among Hedi Klum’s clover for her jewelry line, or Muaawad’s clover for their jewelry line, or Lucky Brand’s clover logo, or marshmallow Lucky charms, or the millions of clover tattoos out there… When the logo seems uninviting, it seems to go downhill from there to us. On a brighter note, we are digging the Fina clutch . *Images courtesy of asos.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I want to do something different but still want to be appropriate. After all, I am young and love fashion. Can you help me please? Thanks for your help. “ There are numerous ways to look office appropriate but stylish simultaneously. Right now I’m writing this while donning wool leggings, a long tunic sweater, leather jacket and fringed scarf (all black)…at the office. On the other hand, we’d still have to say that it depends on where you work and how lenient their dress code is. But even if the job requires you to wear a blazer on a daily basis, you can still manage to make it look chic. We’d recommend starting off with 6 basic wardrobe staples any fashionable working woman needs, and then altering looks with funky accessories. Who says you can’t wear yellow pumps to work, or a fab multi-chained necklace? We say don’t shy away from playing up otherwise boring looks by adding simple yet striking additions. And don’t forget, work it girl! (literally as well…) *Images courtesy of net-a-porter.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I’ve been eying the blue version of the ones seen here on Dakota, and kinda wondering if I should go for the purchase. My sister thinks they are totally disgusting, and that I’m too old to pull it off ( not I’m not 45, don’t go freaking out…just 26! ) I have to admit that the black versions started to grow on me after seeing the whole look that Miss Fanning put together (pairing them with a chic blazer to ease up the edgy), but still too grunge for me. What do you guys think of her jeans? And if you like them, they’re available here for a pretty reasonable $117. *Images courtesy of justjared.com and chickdowntown.com .

Well the first looks are out and it’s obvious that the line is directed towards teenagers. As opposed to their more refined fashion lines such as Elizabeth and James and The Row, this line has a younger more grungy feel. Honestly, I doubt I’ll be donning any of the pieces personally but I still think it was a great idea for them to branch out like this. For those of you in New York, the line will be marketed in a very unique and fun way. An Olsenboye truck will be cruising around New York selling merchandise and giving out cupcakes, balloons and pins, and empty racks in 50 high-profile stores will be covered in Olsenboye shrouds.” For three days only, if you catch the truck you’ll be able to preview the whole collection, shop, and eat treats! Happy shopping!",

She exudes a bright, sunny presence taking after her hometown Miami, Florida. This 26 year old is a blogger, who we can safely say, has gotten chameleon style down pat. She can dress up like an elegant movie star, or dress down like a rocker girl. The unwavering factor in it all? Her love for fashion. Take a look at what she had to say to us, and then head on over to her lovely blog . Chic Intuition: We’ve been following your blog for a while now, and noticed the evolution of your style. What triggers your outfit choices? Erika: Thank you. Being a fan of your website, that means a lot!! I change depending on mood and whatever I am immersing myself with from all around. I pull from everything that inspires me in someway. Celebrities play a large role, of course, as do model’s style choices and preferences; but a lot of it also stems from music, movies and magazines that inspire me. Mood definitely plays a large role. Chic Intuition: We love seeing street style photos from different fashion capitals, there’s a certain vibe that can be associated with each city. Do you feel that living in Miami influences your style? Erika: To be honest, no. All I see are tank tops, jeans/shorts and flip flops. I call it “messy beach bum wear without any flair.” I like to pretend I live in another City or Country when I’m getting dressed to go out (be it to dinner or to the grocery store.) Chic Intuition: On your blog you state that you “breathe and dream in fashion.” Any future plans in the industry? Erika: I sure hope so!! Styling professionally is my ultimate dream, but I’d also love to dabble in writing, fashion coverage from all over the World, if possible. Chic Intuition: You were featured on the Urban Outfitters Catalog (yay!). Do spill details! How was the experience for you? Erika: Exciting, I was contacted to model a few pieces for the blog and then they would later choose which one to showcase on their website. I was notified of being online on Urban Outfitters’s homepage by many of my Facebook friends, shout outs to them!! Chic Intuition: So we can’t ignore the fact that you own a pair of the greatly coveted Sam Edelman booties ( reminiscent of the Olsens’ Balenciaga’s ). No one could predict their online popularity. Do you have any idea how many fashionistas would kill for a pair? Erika: It all started when I first saw them gracing the Olsens’ feet. Especially MK’s. When I saw how easily they pulled an outfit together my heart couldn’t stop beating for them. I enjoyed watching the many ways Mary-Kate incorporated them into just about any and every look (with mini dresses, skinny jeans and extra long t-shirts) were ( and still are ) my favorite. Then Rumi got them, only enticing me further. Now that I finally have them, I must admit the magic has yet to disappear, I just love them that much. ( thanks to Nicole for hooking me up! ) Chic Intuition: Talking about the Olsens, we think we’ve finally found someone who’s as obsessed with them as we are. What do you think their secret to style is? Erika: I think the truth is not overthinking it. They grab and they go. Always effortless yet pulled together, just enough. It also doesn’t hurt that they have access to every single label I dream and covet to run my fingers over…. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how stylish is too stylish? Erika: When you are wearing one designer head to toe and it’s either too matchy-matchy or costumey. Mix high & low, that’s the best; especially Vintage- my favorite. *Images courtesy of fashionchalet.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Although the outfits won’t be out till December, that gives you more than enough time to save up for your faves. And by ‘ saving up ‘ we mean putting away a nickel a day. Yes ladies, the looks range from $20 to $70 tops. The looks seem kind of summery to us, but we’re willing to let that slide. Seriously, will anyone go back to buying actual designer clothing after all these collaborations? *Images courtesy of nylongmag.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Let alone the fact that she has, well, perfect features in our minds, her fresh-faced fall makeup is the best photo you can follow. We already hinted at what products you need to invest in this winter, but to get her look here: Moisturize the face and neck area with Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer . With a large brush, evenly apply Bare Escentuals i.d bareMinerals Powder Foundation all over. Focus on the cheeks and temples for extra highlights. Afterwards, smoothly dab Benefit Boi-ing Concealer under and around the inner corner of the eyes. With a soft brush, apply Sephora Light Touch Highlighter from the lashline all the way up to the brow bone of the eyes. Don’t over apply. With a small brush, line the upper and lower lashlines with Dior Impression Cuir Leather Couture eyeshadow. The key here is to be messy, and not focus on applying a straight, bold line. Finish off the eyes with generous coats of Givenchy Phenomenon Eyes Mascara . To achieve high volume without applying false eyelashes (as seen on Kim Kardashian), apply one coat of mascara, wait a bit, and apply the second. With a small brush, apply Cargo blu-ray Blush/Highlighter to the apples of the cheeks. Line your lips with Nars lipliner in Jungle Red . With a lipstick brush, apply Kat Von D Painted Love in Hellbent . Smile, and walk out the door! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Well, of course, us Chics had to jump on the bandwagon and decided to search the internet to find the best zippered pieces out there. It all started with a blouse and ended with shoes, bags, and even a bracelet! Here are our faves: 1. Zip Ruffle Neck Blouse 2. Luc Kieffer Zipper Bangle 3.

Fashionistas around the globe must be giddy with glee over these first shots of Carrie Bradshaw out and about NYC. This really proves that the movie is a go, full force ahead. We noticed something interesting in this shot, seems like the stylist of the movie, Patty Field, is tackling the recession subject. Carrie’s dress looks like a simple jersey that you can find in any retail shop. But of course, when it comes to her heels they had to go with Mr. Louboutin. Obviously we’ll let it slide, hey its SaTC at the end of the day! *Images courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Nothing compared to the original GAP logo that we’re so used to. Happy to say that the retailer actually went back to their original logo. Our fave hate comment? “I think [the logo] could be slightly more boring if they really made the effort. They can’t even do boring right anymore”. So the blogosphere is king!

Am I the only person who thinks that no matter what she wears, no matter how couture or expensive or stylish the item of clothing is, Paris just manages to skank-ify it? The way she accessorizes, poses, and just IS makes her a major NO. Just goes to show you that money can’t buy class. Take a look below and decide for yourselves. *Images courtesy of people.com .

Me and Chic Freak have been excitedly anticipating the new Cartier Love Charity bracelet ever since last year’s was sold out… We decided that if the new one had rose gold, it would definitely land on our list of must-haves. Well, lo and behold it does have a rose gold ring intwined with a white gold ring and let’s just say we are both in LOVE. The only catch is that it’s a little pricey at $995 but $200 of that goes to charity so maybe that makes it a little better? The charity you donate to is determined by the color of the bracelet so choose wisely. Below is a list of celebrity ambassadors and their charity of choice. Orange bracelet – Fergie for The Peapod Foundation Gunmetal Grey bracelet – Janet Jackson for The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance Peach bracelet – Eve for Women in Transition Khaki bracelet – Common for The Common Ground Foundation Royal Blue bracelet –Ashanti for Boys & Girls Club of America Deep Jade Green bracelet – Good Charlotte for The Ritchie-Madden Children’s Foundation Deep Plum Purple bracelet – Hilary Duff for Blessings in a Backpack Pink Bracelet – Emmy Rossum for Susan G.

Why you may ask? Well because she was spotted wearing an almost exact replica of the top LC wore months ago at Us Weekly’s Hot Hollywood Party this week in NY. Do you think maybe she thinks that by emulating LC in any possible way, her own show might be just as successful? Hmmm something to ponder upon… *Images courtesy of imnotobsessed.com and people.com .

I can’t help but be in awe everytime she steps in the room. Now wonder any guy within 3 ft of her ends up falling hard! One of the most dramatic looks for me was when she went to work late at night wearing a beautiful coat over her one shoulder black dress. I must admit I was WOWED and had to find this coat’s designer. Being a huge fan of Nanette Lepore, I just knew that Serena’s coat would be by her. And… it was! Get it here .

I remember close to a year ago someone actually had the nerve to make the call and declare leggings as “so out!” I secretly giggled a little inside thinking “are you serious?” and still don’t understand how she figured that was true… Well just to make things more concrete, designers galore have jumped on the leggings bandwagon trying to figure out ways to make them more original by giving them their own signature touches.

I personally think it’s $995 wasted. Why you may ask? Because I’ve attempted needlepoint before and I was never able to finish what I started. It’s just that after awhile the stitches feel like they will never amount to anything making one lose all hope and toss the canvas aside. Although the idea of personalizing you own bag is very appealing, I prefer to use the $995 on a bag that’s ‘ready to go’ if you know what I mean… What do you think, are you up for the challenge or will you pass on this project?",

It all started on the Chanel runway for Fall 2009 and ended up on celebs and bloggeristas galore and I’m proud to say I have jumped onto the green nailpolish loving bandwagon. The trick to achieving perfect green nails? It has to be a minty fresh shade like Mint Candy in this Essie Winter Mini 4-Pack . Also, a glam chunky cocktail ring ( perhaps by Chanel? ) couldn’t hurt I guess… *Image courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Although it’s pretty simple, something about it just makes it pop. I really like the floral dress under a simple black blazer and fierce sandals combo and I’m sure most of you did as well. Unfortunately, Jessica’s actual dress is by Thakoon which would set most of us back a month’s rent or so! I decided to go on the lookout for a similar but more affordable version of her outfit on asos.com and must say I was successful. To get the look, follow the three simple steps below… 1. Lipsy Strapless Print Dress $77 2. Mango Tailored Blazer $94 3. Miss KG Rocco Cut Out Shoe Boot $111 *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

This store will be selling the new Gap premium denim line 1969 slated for release in the Fall. “With this new collection, named in honor of Gap’s debut year, we completely reworked and redesigned the jeans at every level, from design and fit to fabric, fasteners and production,” said Gap’s EVP of Design, Patrick Robinson. “Our goal was to create a range of styles that were cool, sexy and relevant for right now. Every style tells a story and there’s a fit for everyone – we created great fitting jeans that really complement and accentuate different body types.” I will definitely be going up to LA to checkout this cool store and get me some jeans which start from $59.50 FYI! If you’re interested in going as well, the shop will be open from Friday, August 7, 2009 – Sunday, September 27, 2009 (Monday – Sunday: 10:30 a.m. – 7:00 p.m) at 108 N Robertson Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90048.",

I was looking for something fun and young and similar to the ones his models were wearing with their gorgeous colorful outfits. I ended up stumbling on this Juicy Couture Summer of Love Necklace and must confess that I am in L.O.V.E. I know I’ve said this so many times but, unlike real love, my love for fashion items is constantly being redistributed… Anyways, back on topic, this necklace is the perfect piece to add to your fall outfits and can be even saved for spring cuz statement necklaces will still be SO IN by then. A versatile piece for fall and spring. What more could a girl want? *Images courtesy of style.com and their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

She was rocking those gladiator wedges, and it kinda helped that she has legs as long as the Eiffel Tower. So, I searched high and low till I found the actual pair, by APC . Only problemo? They go for about $400! Wanna look as good as Alexa for less?

The first person that came to mind when you mentioned the combo was Pandora the French blogger. She’s famously known for dressing up her Wayfarer glasses, and we even like to think that she’s the one that first decided to exchange her sunny lenses for prescription ones. Don’t even think twice about working this trend, just make sure to do it after the sun goes down. *Images courtesy of misspandora.fr , and chictopia.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

If you haven’t heard of them already, they’re a site that provides fashion enthusiasts online access to designer fashion from top brands at sample sale prices ! Ya, amazing huh?! What we love about them is the fact that they email you alerts notifying upcoming sales. So back to our sickness: we actually sit and wait for sales to start (noon EDT) to grab up whatev we’ve been eying. The site is invite only, so click here and join if you havn’t already. Check out what’s going on sale today: *Images courtesy of giltgroupe.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Rachel Zoe’s style assistant, Taylor, has some bangin’ style and I love the plaid shirt that she wore in the first episode! In the words of Zoe, “ it’s BANANAS! ” Any idea where I can find it?” Ok Krstyle we’ve got good news and bad news. The good news: we know who the top is by. The bad news? It’s two years old, meaning you can’t really purchase it online (and yes we tried ebay as well). How would we know anything about a two year old top? Well, that’s due to the magical powers of us editors here at Chic Intuition. Once we read your email, Chic Critic and I were on a full fledged discussion about the top. I mentioned to her that I remember spotting Lindsay wearing it on a celeb blog, and I even remembered that she was shopping at Barney’s. Weird huh? Ya, my fellow co-editor was kind of freaked out. After a couple of clicks (love you internet!) we found some pics to prove our point. And yes, we also remembered that it was by Stella McCartney. Its called the Check Top, and its from 2006 .

Hot pieces, great prices, and being able to pay your credit card bill at the end of each month is the new thing! This trend is so hot that even fashionistas such as Jessica Szohr, Kim Kardashian, and Olivia Palermo have hopped on the budget-friendly wagon. True, they pair their inexpensive pieces with a Temperly London jackets, Zanotti shoes, and an Hermes Birkin but it’s nice to see that at least part of their look is under $100… *Images courtesy of style.com and imnotobsessed.com .

Meet 22 year old Kelly who hails from the Windy City. Her love for fashion and design has evolved into a blog that spills her hopes and fashion dreams. Keep your eye out for this hot designer, we sure are. Chic Intuition: We love hearing from fashionistas on how they started their blogs. Do spill please! Kelly: Well, anyone who knows me, knows I talk A LOT. My family and friends can all attest to having to listen to hours and hours of me talking about fashion, shopping, designers, etc. So I just decided to give them a break, but still have a release to talk about these things. I originally started chatting on fashion forums which is where I was introduced to the idea of starting a blog. Chic Intuition: Now, we noticed that you sew a lot of your own clothing, and they are just fab. Do you see fashion anywhere in your future? And in what amount? Kelly: Yes, of course, I love fashion and everything about it. I actually majored in fashion design in college. I would love to design for a fashion house, that would be simply amazing to me or even to create my own clothing line. I have even taken up wardrobe styling and am currently toying with the idea of adding Journalism to my major so I can possibly write articles for magazines. The jury’s still out though. Chic Intuition: We sensed that you are quite the family girl. Do your mother or sisters have any influence on your style sense? Kelly: When I was younger my sisters influenced my style, but as I’ve gotten older we have all just gravitated toward completely different styles of dressing. I still value their opinions but other than accessories our taste differs. Chic Intuition: Anything you regret donning? Kelly : Oh don’t make me say it. I cringe at the idea of me wearing those off brand “Manolo Blahnik/Jenny From The Block” boots. Yes I admit it, I was one of those girls to wear those boots and I loved them. But now as I look back I can’t help but say, “what was I thinking.” Chic Intuition: Online shopping: addictive or annoying? Kelly: Are you kidding….addictive. Oh I am a slave to 3:00 a.m. online shopping. Shopbop.com , tobi.com , and eBay.com have all fallen prey to my late night shopping addictions. I think I need help. Chic Intuition: In your Gucci Fall 08 post , you managed to single-handedly transcend the runway looks into real life snapshots. How easy/hard for you is it to mirror fashion house trends? Kelly: I guess its relatively easy. As I view a runway I mentally go through which items I have in my closet that flows with that collection. But then again, I am like a packrat. I still have clothes from when I was 12, I know scary. But that makes it so much easier to find pieces that fit into a collection when I have a large variety to choose from. Chic Intuition: Scenario: your fave fashion house is closing down. What item of theirs would you scurry to save and why? Kelly: Hands down Balenciaga’s harness boots from fall 06 and of course Chanel’s original quilted clutch. Both had big impacts on the fashion world. Chanel’s quilted handbag is always timeless. And of course Balenciaga’s sculpted harness boots (both ankle and knee high version) are simply amazing to me. Chic Intuition : Finally, philosophical question time. How tight is too tight? Kelly: I always do a pinch test, if there isn’t enough give in the fabric for a pinch then its too tight. *Images courtesy of alafemme.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

It is a piece that can easily be dressed up or even down to make an always fierce fashion statement.

That doesn’t mean to necessarily eliminate any spending, but to consider each purchase as an investment. That’s why when I saw these Steven By Steve Madden Women’s Martiny Open Toe Strappy Ankle Boots , I was hooked. Number 1, they’re on sale. Number 2, they are sandals. Number 3, they are booties. If you didn’t catch on yet: these babies are perfect for both winter and summer and come at a great price point. I’m going to click on through and get myself a pair because I think they’ll definitely be handy in these California winters. Phew! I’m glad I don’t have to give up on shopping completely…",

She has looked everywhere … from fashion mags…to blogs…to taking fashion quizzes…to a never ending Google search! Please HELP! Please please please find them for us! I heard you guys are the BEST in fashion investigations! Thank you loads!” First off, talk about good taste! Second off, you readers are killing us. I mean, the challenges you put us through are just that: challenging! But at the end of the day, victory is just that much sweeter when we’re able to answer your oh so detailed questions. When we read this email, knowing Lady Gaga, we assumed the pumps were vintage. But after sorting through our mental Rolodex of fashionable finds, the light bulb went off. Who could forget such a hot shade of pink? And in pumps no less. Ok B sorry, to put you and your friend out of your misery, here’s the answer: they’re Stella McCartney Silk Stiletto Pumps in Pink . The reason for their allure is the fact that they’re “ styled in a fabric called “Scuba,” which is a stretch fabric similar to a scuba suit (we assume), but to our eyes it looks like a very matte silk. ” Interesting… *Images courtesy of celebutopia.net and intermixonline.com.

Although the fashion in this episode wasn’t very plentiful, since the girls were in their school uniforms most of the time, it all came out at the opera. Oh the opera! The girls all looked beautiful and the night’s star was Ms Blair Waldorf herself as usual. Her Dior Resort 2009 dress was out of this world. For the first time with Blair’s fashion choices, we can actually look forward to buying it instead of scouring for it on Ebay. Keep your eyes open ladies and please let us know… Now I just can’t wait for next episode because it sure looks juicy! xoxo, Chic Critic (Oh ya!

                            "post_text_content": "January 26, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview The moment we first spotted this 19 year old from Norway, we new we had to add her to our ever evolving Bookmarks Tab (under the Folder appropriately entitled Hot Bloggers! ). Maria manages to make daily outfit posts events on their own, with amazing thrift purchases that melt our hearts. The fact that she’s so laid back is even more assurance that it’s not hard to look good. It just takes a little style, and some lovely scents… Chic Intuition: So what is vanilla scented? Your cologne? Room? Car? Maria: Yeah my car. Hehehe. I was trying to come up with a name for the blog, and my actual Vietnamese name is “Van”, so I searched for it on the web and up came vanilla. Thought it was cute but I wanted something more and so I added “scented”. As exciting as that. Chic Intuition: We’re not going to ask the boring question of why you started a blog, but rather, what keeps you posting? Maria: Why dress up if no one can see you? I want to share my interest in fashion and trends with others. Also all of the positive feedback I get from people encourages me to keep posting. Chic Intuition: What would you say are 3 main inspirations to your daily outfits? Maria: I want to look cool, laidback and trendy. Other than that I’m very inspired by other bloggers, the catwalk, street style and celebs. Chic Intuition: Scenario, you’ve only got 10 minutes to pack for a quickie tropical getaway. What items do you stash in your suitcase? Maria: Doesn’t matter! We’re talking about a tropical getaway here! Haha. I’d need a sheer white tanktop, light washed ripped jeans shorts, a cool cut-out bathing suit and I’m good to go! Chic Intuition: Vintage vs New. What do you prefer and why? Maria: That’s a hard one! No way I could chose.. Vintage, because the items are unique and the quality and shapes is hard to find nowadays. New, because trends and fashion keeps evolving and I gotta catch up! Chic Intuition: We literally stored the images of your DIY studded leather jacket. How many compliments (aka girls trying to grab it off you) have you gotten so far? Maria: 573. Hehe no. But many! I see why – it is killah I couldn’t be more satisfied with it! Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how ruffled is too ruffled? Maria: When people start talking about wedding cakes wherever you go. *Images courtesy of vanillascented.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

The intrigue turned to absolute obsession after I saw the last episode of Gossip Girl where Blair was donning a similar sparkling headband with her gorgeous one-shouldered yellow dress and let’s just say the effect was visually intoxicating! Well I got down to researching Blair’s hot headband and, lo and behold, it’s the same designer as Nicole Richie’s! The designer is Jennifer Behr and the prices are a little steep but oh so worth it if paired with dramatic eveningwear. Don’t you love us just a little more now? *Images courtesy of gossipgirlinsider.com , jenniferbehr.com , and people.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Though her daily wear might seem simple and easy, the jeans she’s always in are anything but. I personally own a pair, and swear by them. There’s nothing more ‘in’ than to throw a sheer tee over a pair of destroyed denim. One rule: don’t expose too much. The amount of wear and tear shouldn’t be more than necessary (like enough where you can actually feel a draft between your legs). You guys are probably like ‘just tell us who the jeans are by lady! ‘, but honestly it’s not about who they’re by but what…. ok ok just kidding . You can get yourself a pair here .

I love the new skinny heel placement and the funky cross between a heel and a wedge! I definitely can see these babies gaining cult status among fashionistas everywhere just like the YSL tribute pumps did last season… Ukh! Just another reason to look forward to Fall.

We felt it only necessary to freshen up our look, it’s been a bit over 2 years since we first started this venture that we called Chic Intuition. When we decided to create a little blog based on the personal chats we had online, we never knew that it would grow to have hundreds of thousands of followers from all over the world. If someone would have told us a few years back that we would get invites to fashion week, guest blog for Glamour’s fashion editor, and meet a whole new group of friends in the blogosphere, we would have voluntarily checked them into the psych ward. We owe all these opportunities to you, the readers. Without your support and kind words, Chic Intuition wouldn’t be what it is today. Keep following, keep enjoying, and keep chic! We have tons of surprises in store for your guys, and we’re just starting the style revolution…",

We’ve found an eerily similar cut by Issa which you can purchase here . Happy shopping! edit: We found out that her actual dress is by Issa as well!

So it seems like lately with this tired economy it’s all about saving and making smart purchases. That’s why when on the search of the perfect Boyfriend Jeans for myself, I wanted to make sure not to spend too much. Why you may ask? Because I consider the BF jean to be a trendy and not a staple piece for my wardrobe- one that I expect will disappear by the fall. I may be wrong, though, since I was wrong about the skinny jean but I’m willing to try it out and maybe invest in a more expensive pair if I see a future for them. Sounds like I’m getting married or something huh? Lol! Anyways, I went on the lookout and found four amazing pairs for under $50! Check ’em out and help me choose which one to get. Indigo Saints Shredded Boyfriend Jean $49.50 Frayed Denim Capri $22.80 BDG Boyfriend Patchwork Jean $29.99 Charlie Low-Rise Boyfriend Jean $49.50</post_text_content><commentstype=\"array\" type=\"array\"><comment><Text>I’m not sure I’ll ever get use to this trend – it reminds me too much of the elastic tapered jeans you see in the Sears catalogue.</Text><Timestamp_parsed>2009/02/10</Timestamp_parsed><Timestamp_unparsed>Kira on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 10th, 2009 6:40 am \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tI’m not sure I’ll ever get use to this trend – it reminds me too much of the elastic tapered jeans you see in the Sears catalogue.</Timestamp_unparsed></comment><comment><Text>I do not like one or three.

The other type of hobos (aka the handbag kind) are right up my alley. Come to think of it, hobo handbags were probably named after the kind of bags that hobos carry, right?. Hmm, interesting revelation. Ok enough blabbing and back to the topic of the day: Vanessa Hudgen’s JJ Winters Suede Zip bag . What do you think? I was kind of on the line about this one, but decided that after a few looks that it’s quite cute. I’m a girl that likes zippers, so the more the merrier, and it comes in distressed black as well! To get your hands on her bag, click here . Oh, and we also recognized her ring ! Loves it. P.S. We just started a twitter page!

A few years back, I wouldn’t have called myself a winter person, but now more than ever I’ve started to appreciate Fall and all it has to offer, especially in the fashion aspect. I love being able to pile on layers and layers of my favorite pieces. You can’t top the feeling of walking into a restaurant, saying hello to your girls, taking off your leather jacket, and revealing a hot sweater underneath to a chorus of oohs and aaahs . The element of surprise is undeniably fulfilling.

We always had the disappointing answer of ‘ check eBay ‘, since these shoes were created exclusively for Victoria’s Secret online, and obviously sold out by the time you could say ‘ hotness ‘. Well ladies, good news. These babies are back up for grabs. For a limited time only, you can purchase them online (and for half the price may we add)! So hurry and get your studded booties fix before it’s too late. *Images courtesy of victoriassecret.com , karlascloset.com , fashiontoast.com , taghrid.blogspot.com and stylorectic.blogspot.com .

Check out the photographic evidence below. As usual, Whitney never fails to impress us with her fashion choices, and we couldn’t help but notice she’s toting the Rebecca Minkoff Supernova Stud Devote Hobo . On a side note, don’t you find it funny that Jay seems to be the one dressed up here and Whit is sort of dressed down grunge style? Seems like they traded style tastes. Maybe they traded roles in other aspects of their lives as well. We wonder if that means Whitney’s finally holding the reins in the relationship? Guess we’ll find out on the next season of The City… *Images courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

It’s been awhile since we’ve helped you achieve a celeb’s fresh-faced look and Kate’s is the perfect face with which to make a comeback! To get her look: Face: Rub You Rebel in Lite all over face and neck. Eyes: Brush Bare Essentials bareMinerals Glimmer in Sunshine onto eyelids from lashline to browbone. Next, line eyes with Clinique Quickliner in Black/Brown . Lastly, use the Lancome ÔSCILLATION – Vibrating Infinite Powermascara on top and bottom eyelashes. Cheeks : Apply a few drops of Benefit Posie Tint onto cheekbones. Rub it in using tips of fingertips. Repeat until desired flush is achieved. Lips: Slick Dior Addict Ultra Gloss Reflect in Organza Pink onto lips and VOILA you’re ready for a night on the town! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links.

I love Chic Intuition and I always know that you can help a fellow fashionista in need I came across these photos of Hayden Panettiere and instantly fell in love with her feather sequin top by Topshop. However, it is now sold out on their UK site. I love the elegance of the sequins and beading with the mint green color and feather shaped detail. Can you please help me find a very similar top with the same elegance?! In the mean time I plan to wait it out on ebay for the same one or a restock on Topshop Thank you! “ Hi Kimberly! Thanks for the love. Well, we looked all around for a similar top and we were completely unsuccesful until we were working on another story looking for dresses and stumbled on a very similar piece! Yay! It’s the MLH Selena Floral Sequin Dress and I personally think it will look amazing belted over a pair of super skinny jeans and some heels. Hope this helps!",

Their looks are the epitome of easy, breezy, summer chic! I’m especially digging the striped top and oversized sunglasses look. Don’t real-life (and not alien celebrities :p) well dressed people make fashionable style just a little more tangible??? You should ask Chic Freak, she actually made me go shopping for her to help recreate a previously featured fab street chic look. Can you guess which one? Hint: DVF! *Images courtesy of elle.com .

We support any great designer like the next chick, but we honestly won’t buy an item just because a celebrity designed it. Camila unveiled her boho inspired handbag collection entitled Muxo (“Goddess of the water” in an African legend) at Kitson, LA. At least she’s doing some good with her profits, the collection is associated with Stand Up To Cancer and will soon be releasing a SU2C handbag. What do you think of the extra extra fringed up handbag Camila is sporting? *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Remember when we’d find you the stuff after the episodes and it would all be sold out??? Well now, we are attacking each outfit while they’re still shooting. Here’s to planning ahead! xoxo, Chic Critic *Image courtesy of gossipgirlinsider.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

                            "post_text_content": "January 13, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview She might be new to the blogging world, but we have a feeling that this girl has some lasting power. Her posts are sweet, short, and damn hot (just like her!). Take a look at what this 31 year old girl hailing from Vienna has to say about everything from peeing in public to how hot her grandpa is. Loves it! Then head on over to Eszter’s blog … Chic Intuition: The first thing we noticed about your blog, it’s grunge-alicious! We love your take on rocker chic. How’d your style evolve? Eszter: Thanks hun. There is so much inspiration around. I am constantly evolving. Hopefully forever! Also I am not the graceful type I guess. I kinda feel like a lipstick-tomboy who loves to get down and dirty and feels and behaves awkwardly from time to time. Altogether I feel more comfortable on the tough side. Yes. Chic Intuition: It takes a bit of guts and a lot of time to blog. What got you into the blogosphere? Eszter: I planned an online shop first, therefore the name and first posts. It was kinda a test. It still is. Hey, I still don’t have a clue wtf I am doing. The blog is relatively new and I didn’t think about a concept or so before. Its big fun and definitely the best thing about it is that you meet amazing people around the globe you would never get to meet otherwise. but also i feel awkward posting myself sometimes, you know? I don’t take clothes or myself too seriously and I am shy and sometimes also pretty insecure. So it’s a challenge too somehow. A fun one! And hell yeah, its a good cause to buy more shoes! Chic Intuition: What are your picks for top shopping destinations, online and off? Eszter : Must be definitely eBay , I buy nearly everything there! Also etsy.com , asos.com . For shoes: eBay ! And some skankaliciously good shoe retailers like VS , Bebe …And when money is flat: gojane, urbanog. Others are the usual ones like H&M , AA , Zara , and a few national shops around town. Chic Intuition: Are those zipper leggings we caught you wearing? So dope! Did you make them yourself? Eszter: Oh no, mommy ‘Hot Topic’ made them for me. I suck at sewing big times. Chic Intuition: You seem to be fond of black, like our past interviewee Jaime. If you were told you could NEVER wear black again, what other color/s would you opt for? Eszter: Oh I love every color and wore all of them. The only color you will never see me in is light blue and maybe other pastels (except nude). I just don’t feel good in them. Chic Intuition: We know your blog focuses on the fashion in your life, but how about some details about your personal life. Tell our reader 5 interesting facts about yourself. Eszter: I am extroverted-introverted. I guess the longest I’ve gone without sleeping were 4 days. I like to pee in public places from time to time. I pretended once to be member of a sect to get a bed to sleep in. I am kinda convinced I will die in a tramway accident. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: how bad is plaid? Eszter: Grandpa looks fly in it. Can’t be that bad then. *Images courtesy of stylorectic.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I know I may be a little late to jump on this bandwagon but the T-Shirts I’m loving are not the light cotton basic type, but actually the embellished and reinvented kind. I recently bought a light grey cotton tshirt whose collar is lined with a silver chain and am on the search for others. My latest admiration goes to this amazing Valentino Red Bow-Back T-Shirt whose look and pricepoint really make a girl swoon. Hurry up though because this baby got sold out within minutes of it arriving and I’m pretty sure it’ll happen again!",

So after spotting this image of her on Knighttcat ‘s blog, we had to get you guys the look for less. We can safely assume that 75% of her outfit is Chloe, therefore also leading us to assume that the total cost of her look with be in the thousands. How much for the duplicated look? $219.

The show is basically a behind the scenes look at the high-powered and fast-paced world of fashion PR featuring public relations guru Kelly Cutrone. She’s been called one of the “coolest, most intimidating persons ever,” and, judging from her frank demeanor and fashion world credibility, it’s easy to see why. Cutrone balances running her wildly successful fashion PR company, People’s Revolution, juggling Fashion Weeks in New York and London, with being a single mother and one of New York’s most notable women about town. Personally some of my fave “The City” moments always had Kelly involved. The lady knows how to make good reality TV. Take a look at the preview below, and if you like it we’d recommend tuning into Bravo Monday nights 10/9c.",

I mean, feels like we just started getting our daily lives in check around Monday nights. For example: “Hey Chic Freak, wanna grab dinner tonight?”, pause and think what tonight is, “Oh hun, I can’t. I have a….dentist appointment”. Why lie? No friend wants to hear that they’re ditched for a TV show. So I guess the lying might stop now… Want to hear what’s in store for the last episode? After her recent struggle with Vertigo, Rachel gets strict doctors orders that she needs to slow down or she will wear herself out. The solution? Rachel calls a team meeting to announce that Rodger will be taking over the business side of Rachel Zoe Incorporated. But how will this affect Taylor’s role on the team? With her frustration with her job at a breaking point, Taylor finally confronts Rachel with her issues and her future on Team Zoe – will Rachel honor her requests or will Taylor quit?",

Her perfected matte face and shimmery bronze eyes are coupled with a shy nude lip, and we know you all want to copy her! To get the look: With a wet sponge, apply YSL Matt Touch Foundation SPF 10 onto your face and neck. An important secret is to always apply foundation in upward motions; helps ward away future facial sagging! Then slowly rotate blush brush onto apples of the cheeks with Sephora Smashbox Blush. I love applying blush to my face as a first after foundation, this helps your face pop. With your fingertips, apply the lightest shade (Bouquet) on the Stila Eyeshadow Pan pallete all over your eyelids and browbone. Then smother your lids with the medium shade (Jezebel). Finally finish off inner and outer eye corners with the darkest brown shade (Espresso). Smudge Clinique Quickliner in Dark Chocolate on upper and lower lashes. It’s ok to be messy, that’s our fave part about the smoky eye! Look up, and generously apply Givenchy Phenom Eyes mascara to upper lashes. Finally, look in the mirror; SMILE and apply Vincent Longo Wet Pearl lipstick in Dahlila Fresh! Viola! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and sephora.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

But, I’m not sure how chic it can look before it becomes white trash. Help me decide!” That’s a great question Mary. We’ve been wanting to discuss this subject for awhile on the site, but didn’t know how to approach a sensitive matter ( sensitive in the sense that we’d offend readers who had one too many piercings themselves! ). So, we decided that we’d be honest and just give our personal opinion. Like we said, it’s our own opinion, so you’re free to disagree! Can you sense that we’re begging for the hate comments to slide this time!? Back to what matters: We think that there should be a limit to the number of piercings a girl should get per ear. For us, the limit would be 3-4. Why may you ask? The ear is such a delicate feature, and just because you can’t feel a whole lot of pain when inflicting it with a needle doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and stab at it as you please. Note our choices for ‘trashy’ celebs who don the trend; they scream 1992, and not in a good way. On the other hand, we love how Rihanna and Hilary chose to just adorn their ears with a few pierces. We also love how they chose tiny earrings for their additional holes. We’d avoid duplicating the same number on the other ear, the effect just cheapens the whole concept. Hope we were helpful and…um…Happy Piercing!! *Images courtesy of popsugar.com and rumorhazzit.blogspot.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

What’s your take on nail art? Celebs seem to always find different, and sometimes cheesy, ways of adorning their nails, even sometimes stating their political views with a few swipes of polish (we’re talking to you Eve). How necessary, and mature, is nail art? Is there a specific forum where it’s appropriate to have little butterflies, stripes, and swooshes on your nails, or can you get away with pretty patterns in a business meeting with your boss? Personally, I think to each her own, and if you’re a performer, have some fun with it. But if you have any links with the corporate world, then stay away (or at least wait till the weekend)… *Images courtesy of people.com , killahbeez.com , and haiba.cn .

Well, not really for the masses, but for people who can afford to pay a few hundred on a piece rather than a few thousand! The advantage? I’m sure, unlike the Target diffusion line, the quality of these pieces will be just as good as the originals. I honestly am a fan. Just because the pieces really embody the trademark Zac Posen design philosophy at a fraction of the price. Just as in lust? Shop the line at saks.com .",

Since it’s still winter in most of the world (sorry Aussies), we thought we’d show you our fave cold weather choices. Honestly, there’s a few more items we couldn’t fit, so try heading there yourself. Just remember to visit before rush hour *wink wink*. *Images courtesy of topshop.com .

Actually, I take it back, since we all know that the trend traveled from the street to the elite over time, and now the highest of the high don the trend. I, like most of you, have been on the hunt for the perfect red lipstick for quite a while now. And I think I finally cracked the code. I was out on a mini shopping spree with one of my besties yesterday, and she had on the most magnificent coral/red lipstick. Upon further investigation, I found out that the shade was by MAC, and called Lady Danger ( ooh, I’m so biting my tongue to avoid placing any puns here ). I’m actually calling the closest MAC shop to inquire if they have the shade in stock, and am going to get a-goin’ right after posting this. Oh, and yes I’m planning on wearing it out in the daylight. Bloody orange lips just scream brunch outing donchya think?! *Images courtesy of style.com , and maccosmetics.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Mary Kate Olsen is no exception, usually looking like she got dressed in the dark… However, once in awhile the pieces that she ‘oh so thoughtlessly’ puts together somehow seem to work. Today is one of those days! As she exits her bf’s place, MK manages to look nonchalantly put together and we love it! To get the look: 1. Monoflora Chiffon Blouse $20 2. H81 Aimee Denim Bermuda $25 3. BDG Men’s Slouch Blazer $78 4. Gladiator Knee High Buckle Thong Flat $33 Total- $156!!! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links.

Here’s what the designer had to say of his inspiration for the line: “We use icons in British music, and [Liela Moss] stood out. She’s a great-looking girl and has a personal style. It fell into the idea of the New York underground music scene. It was more the atmosphere she portrays.” And more on the line itself: “The collection has a muted color palette of black, white, gray and tan with accents of cobalt blue and bright pink. Studs and mesh give items an edge. There are studded jeans, shorts and denim jackets with asymmetrical closures, short tuxedo jackets and matching shorts, dresses in a blue and white painterly fabric, a one-shoulder dress in a gray-and-black zigzag pattern with a thick black belt, and a T-shirt with the image of Moss. The designer’s favorite pieces in the line include “the pink and black pieces and the little prom dresses.” The images below are (left) of Leila in in a cotton mesh dress and rayon tank from McQ Alexander McQueen for Target, and the image on the right features a Silk-screen cotton jersey T-shirt over cotton and spandex denim pants by McQ Alexander McQueen for Target. Personally, we’re not feeling it yet. Pretty plain jane if you ask us, but we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt and wait for more images before we reach a final decision. *Images courtesy of wwd.com .

They are an interesting concept considering that most of us can’t afford their pricey baubles and yet can get a similar look for a lot less. What do you all think? Would you don them ? *Images courtesy of refinery29.com and static.guim.co.uk . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Zoe said nothing is designed just yet but expect to see “faux furs and incredible leather jackets and great trousers. Subconsciously or consciously, my whole final goal — I don’t want to say final because that sounds very like it’s the end — but I would say my ultimate dream scenario was to be on the design side ,” said Zoe.

It seems they have a knack at choosing the wrong models ( ahem ahem Lindsay Lohan and Kirsten Dunst) so I thought that Katie would be someone along those lines… After seeing this ad from Vogue UK, though, I must admit I am pleasantly surprised! Katie looks absolutely beautiful and that dress looks amazing on her! She really should think about steering her own personal style in that direction (a mix of glamour with a slight edginess). Miu Miu, I’ve wronged you. Good Choice! *Image courtesy of wwd.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

                            "post_text_content": "July 14, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview This stunning French fashionista first gained recognition when the glorious Sartorialist aimed his lenses towards her. After a huge uproar from the style community, and many a request to start documenting her wear, Louise decided to start her blog Pandora . Chic Intuition: What encouraged you to start a blog? And what was your reaction to the great press in the blogosphere once your site was up? Louise: I got lots of encouragement from people I know who pushed me to make this blog. Plus, there was a great deal of remarkably positive feedback from the blog world, which made me very happy and determined to continue what I started. Chic Intuition: How would you categorize your style? Did it take long for you to develop a personal sense in fashion? Louise: I can’t really define my style, it’s a mix of the influences around me and all the styles that I witnessed and discovered when I was younger. All these helped me develop a personal style. Chic Intuition: We notice that the ratio of artwork to your outfit images is about 50/50. How influential is art in your day to day life (and style)? Louise: Very important, because I study art but I also have an intense passion for it. What’s more, art inspires me on a daily basis, it shows in the way I decorate my studio or the in the way I dress. I love to draw inspiration from clothes (or an outfit) in a painting, not to copy the look down to the littlest detail but mostly to interpret or capture its essence. Chic Intuition: We just ADORE the glasses! Spill on where you got them please! Louise: They’re Wayfarers from Ray-ban. Chic Intuition: Where do you do most of your shopping? And if you were to recommend the best places to shop in France, what would you say? Louise: With my student budget, I go to a lot of ‘friperies’ (thrift shops/second-hand stores).. I can’t simply afford to buy designer goods. I love the thrift stores of the Marais quarter in Paris. They’re not expensive and there’s also the thrill of scoring an absolute treasure. If not, for shops of the better kind, you can find plenty of them in London’s Brick Lane quarter. Chic Intuition: To this day, what do you honor as your best purchase? Louise: A stunning pair of Pierre Hardy court shoes. Chic Intuition: Since our personal French dictionary only consists of the words bonjour and bonsoir 😛 , what’s your occupation? Anything to do with fashion? Louise: I’m an art history student but I want to delve into fashion some time, particularly in the history of fashion. Chic Intuition: And finally, time for the philosophical question. How short is too short? Louise: It’s way too short when someone tells you on the street you forgot your pants! *Images courtesy of misspandorapandora.blogspot.com and vonedar.blogspot.com .

It’s a re-release of a well known similar combo from last season, at much less a price tag. The perfect mix of leather and denim, and spotted on everyone who is everyone in Hollywood (before us mortals might I add), I knew I had to take plunge and…ok not purchase it ( hey, I just came back from Paris! ) but at least keep an eye on it.

It’s fresh, stylish, and most importantly-reasonably priced. The force behind the line? Two young friends, Rachel and Sue-Ann, self-confessed style addicts. “We were drawn together by our mutual addiction to ‘stylestalking’; scouring magazines, trawling the web and traveling to all parts of the world to devour all things style. We decided to create a label to satisfy our fashion cravings.” Take a look at what Sue-Ann had to say below: Chic Intuition: Our love for Aussie designers is growing by the day. The amount of talent there is overwhelming. What got you into clothing design? Sue-Ann: My best friend Rachel and I were obsessed with clothes but couldn’t find anything we wanted to wear which was within our price point. So we decided to create our own. I think that’s why there is so much great designs coming out of Australia, cause you just need a great idea and anything is possible. Chic Intuition: Coming up with ‘new’ creations in fashion can sometime be quite an aggravating experience. Where do you two find inspiration when you reach a dry spell in design? Sue-Ann: We find blogs really inspiring. The way that girls put stuff together and add their own little touches the world of fashion blogs is pretty amazing our faves are zanita.com.au, fashiontoast.com, 4thandbleeker.com Chic Intuition: Please tell us about your latest collection. Sue-Ann: Our latest collection (will be on the website in July) is called “wipeout” and it is inspired by the fun surf beach culture of Australia. Lots of easy shapes, interesting dye’s and killer LBD’s Chic Intuition: Anything in store for the future of Style Stalker? Where do you see yourselves ten years from now? Sue-Ann: Not too sure, hopefully a shop somewhere fabulous… *Images courtesy of stylestalker.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

But we have to blatantly state that we are in pure awe every time we catch a papz shot of the stars of The City. Whitney and Jay are the perfect example of a pair who manage to keep their personal styles unique while complimenting each other simultaneously.

It was just too matronly for me and the fact that it was my mother-in-law’s favourite label only further proved my point! Well, I don’t think she’ll be too happy with the new collection since it’s absolutely youthful and super-trendy thanks to Mr Isaac Mizrahi. The pieces are gorgeous and are, in my opinion, perfect for a working woman! Check out my fave looks below and if you are as hooked as I am click here . Happy Shopping Ladies!",

By overdosing we mean, can’t get enough of his/her stuff, and keep imagining our closet filled with their items, and then we image ourselves wearing them on a daily basis. Phew!! Well, personally we think it’s impossible, and we think that there should be a name for our certain symptom. It’s called AlexanderWangititis , and we have it. The cure? To purchase at least one of his bags. What we love about his stuff is not only the fact that they actually look better in person, but compared to other designers his bags are pretty reasonable price-wise. Thank God for Shopbop , since they seem to have to most up to date collection of his. Happy Shopping!

On one hand I love the ruffle bottom vest and the grey corset, and yet on the other hand I feel like they may be trying too hard to look tough with the slashed leggings and studded belts. Either way, I think the main issue is with the looks themselves and not the actual pieces. Each paired alone or differently will definitely give hot results.

So make sure to pair gray nails with bright colored clothing, and a good mani. Or else someone might be calling the Dr. for an autopsy… *Images courtesy of glamour.com and opi.com .

First off, they created a Fashion Color Report where they sat down with designers who chose colors that they each felt were trendy for Spring 2008. Then, we heard that they deemed Mimosa the color of 2009. Now, we’ve seen Henry Holland was inspired by the ‘Color of Ideas’ for his latest runway show.

Well, I’m sure most of you forgot about it by now but we were very eager to see if we sent the clutch to a good home. After receiving photos from Chic Reader Crizelle we can finally put the matter to rest. Obviously the clutch has gone to a home where it will be worn with style if this picture is any indication. We love how she paired it with a blazer, floral dress, a belt, and gladiators heels. This my fellow Chicers is a surefire formula for fashion success… Bravo Crizelle and congrats!!!",

Next time try listening to only one of the fashion voices in your head. Miley Cyrus: Ummm… can I get a SKANKY??? Nikki Reed: Lesson number one, the cut of a dress has to be edgy enough to carry the print.

Something about her outfit choice looked so familiar until I stumbled upon this pic of Jackie and John Kennedy. Once again the Obama family proves to be quite smart as Michelle chose to modernise the look of the only first lady that was, and still is, considered to be a fashion icon. For the first time in years, the first lady actually looks modern, stylish, and yet sophisticatedly elegant on this big day. Let me say that there have been some major fashion crimes committed by our first ladies over the years (Hilary’s dress anyone?)! Even President Obama is channeling a little of John Kennedy with his long coat over suit type thing. Here’s to hoping that their fashion sense is a good indication of their reign as President and First Lady because, if so, I think they’ll do great! Oh and on a side note, didn’t Malia and Sasha look absolutely adorable in their bright J Crew coats? *Images courtesy of people.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Every single item was a true statement piece on its own, and together, well let’s just say we’re sure the diva in us would jump with glee if we threw a whole outfit together. Named “Air Show”, the collection has been built around the concepts of movement and lightness.

Instead of opting to go with the typical ballerina, why not take the risk with a pair of oxford’s? They look great with almost anything, and the best part is that they’re comfy! We love these Nine West Ronnie pair, that come in a number of colors. So go with the menswear gone glam trend, and enjoy! Best part? There’s a special limited time promotion going on, where you’ll receive 25% off at checkout ! Happy Shopping! *Images courtesy of stylebakery.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Items from names like Target, UO, Bebe… you get where we’re going with this . Honestly, you have to thank the stylists behind their genius of mixing high with low end designers. Celebrities are like the rest of us, and the fact that a ton of people aim at eluding similarities to their fave stars, makes seeing them out and about in affordable clothing feel like, well, a million bucks. *Images courtesy of instyle.com .

This is one of the rare times that I’m actually head over heels about a fashion line created by an actor. We didn’t even know that Hilary Duff was working on a collaboration with DKNY, let alone expect to be disappointed. But to our surprise, the first image of her in her line’s duds had us in a wonderful style daze. I mean, the fringed tee is genius!! And don’t even get us started on the asymmetrical vest.

We love the items, so hippie chic! The headband, bracelets, and rings are all from her line, a collaboration with Mouawad. Take a look and then watch this cute video of Nicole’s appearance on Ellen, where she briefly mentions the line (around the 5 minute mark).",

                            "post_text_content": "May 18, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview These days, it’s rare to find an innovative, contemporary designer, but what’s even more rare is finding one with an eco-friendly line that’s also fashion savvy. Brigid Catiis is the product of a young Los Angeles based designer, who’s obsessed with vintage clothing and accessories. “It felt good knowing that I was the only one that would be wearing my outfit- guaranteed.” After college, she shopped regularly for vintage and soon began making re-creations from vintage clothing, each one uniquely distinct from the other. We got a look at the items up close and personal, and saying that we were blown away is an understatement . The 2nd best part about her 100% green line? The affordable prices. Read on to hear more from the designer and then head on over to her website . Wanna buy? Check out her pieces on revolveclothing . Chic Intuition: Let’s start with the obvious question, what got you interested in fashion design? Raissa: One word: vintage! Having been an avid vintage shopper for almost 7 years now, vintage gave me a history of fashion. I realized that fashion never repeats itself, it just re-invents. It sparked a deep interest and now a love because fashion is a true expression of one’s self. This was made evident through vintage shopping- clothes are expressive in any given era- no matter what! Chic Intuition: We think the idea behind your line is so current and interesting. What made you decide to go green by using renewed vintage fabrics for your pieces? Raissa: It’s funny because I began doing vintage remakes so long ago just for the love of it and the actual realization that I was being the greenest of all green’s came later! I first fell in love with the idea of creating pieces that were exclusive to the person wearing it- one of a kind-always! I knew the best way to do this was to use amazing fabrics that I would see on weirdly shaped dresses and skirts. After gaining momentum from selling to hundreds of women who loved the re-made designs, the light bulb finally went off in my head! I put two in two together and created Brigid Catiis in 2008. Chic Intuition: Do you feel that by not using any new resources you’re creativity, in turn, is limited? Raissa: Yes and no. Yes because I don’t have the luxury of creating necessarily whatever I want. I have to always take into consideration the fabrics that are available to me. However, this makes the design process so much more challenging and therefore, fulfilling. To take something old and breathe new life into the fabric to make a brand new piece takes every inch of creative energy from me, but when I see my ideas come to life from these recycled fabrics, it makes all the effort worth it. Let’s put it this way, it feels like a Project Runway challenge every time I start designing! Like, how do I make brand new women’s trousers from vintage garments? Chic Intuition: What we love about your pieces is that they have a flirty vintage-y feel to them. Do you think that the fabric you use keeps your piece in a relative era? Or do you completely take apart the old piece and revamp it into something more modern? Raissa: Each vintage garment is totally taken apart and made into something else. Most of the time, a dress, playsuit, and even a blouse require 2-3 vintage pieces to create 1 brand new piece. For example, for Spring ’09, I used a lot of denim to make playsuits/rompers. 3-4 vintage denim wrap skirts are required to make one garment, so I have to make sure to buy vintage wrap skirts that are very, very similar in color so that 1 can be created. Yes, it’s hard, time consuming and requires a lot of patience- but I love what I do! Chic Intuition: If you had to choose one favorite piece from your collection, what would it be and why? Raissa: I don’t like this question. I’m bias. I like everything! LOL! If I had to choose just one, which I can’t, I would have to choose 2! Sorry! Rachel and Leah are both playsuits that are easy- easy in terms of not having to think too much to look cute. The pieces are also great for day to night events since it’s casual enough for a bbq, but cute enough to be worn to a bar. I love the fit and how it emphasizes a woman’s waist and both have side pockets. Enough said! Chic Intuition: Now, we have to ask, what line or fashion statement piece do you wish you had designed yourself? Also, just for fun, give us a piece you’re glad you didn’t design. Raissa: I have to give it up for American Apparel. They revolutionized basics and how fashionable it can be. We all own an American Apparel piece for very simple reasons- they’re easy, they’re comfy and they go with everything! American Apparel, in my opinion, catalyzed the t-shirt/tank/leggings/basics staple and they do an amazing job with it! Now, for the piece I’m glad I didn’t design- Uggs. I just don’t get it. I live in L.A. and still see girls wearing them in sunny California. Don’t they make your feet sweat? Chic Intuition: Describe your personal style. What are your three style must-haves? Raissa: It’s hard for me to describe my personal style. I don’t necessary follow trends, but again, just stay true to my taste. I also wear lots of vintage. I would say 90% of what I have in my closet is vintage, so I mix that in with newer pieces. I can tell you that I hardly own any flats and save tennis shoes for the gym. My 3 style must haves are: Animal print: I have been obsessed with animal print since college and I don’t think I’ll ever get over it. LBS: Lovely Black Shoes: Every woman should have a go to pair of black shoes that makes any outfit glamorous! Tuxedo jacket: My Brigid Catiis tuxedo jacket is with me everywhere I go. The tuxedo jacket can turn a jeans and a t-shirt outfit into an amazing jeans and t-shirt outfit! Chic Intuition: Lastly, a philosophical question, how green is to green? Raissa: I don’t think there’s such thing as being too green. With all the information we know now, in regards to the state of our planet, there’s no restrictions on how green we should be.",

I recently bought a tulip skirt from Topshop and I’m having doubts ever since my best friend blatantly told me that it’s soo 80s and fug. I don’t know why but I was attracted to it , unfortunately I don’t know how to wear it, could you please help me out? “ Hey Shahd! Well it is an interesting choice but being that it has the brushstroke effect and a nice color palette, it can look hot if paired with the right pieces. First, I would wear it with all black to avoid color overload. I also took the liberty of choosing a few more pieces from Topshop to help you complete your look. All in all, if you really want to add a pop of color I would suggest a fun purple eyeshadow and maybe an oversized cocktail ring. Hope this helps! *Images courtesy of topshop.com .

According to WWD he’s currently developing a less costly label which will consist of “12 styles — from tanks ($28 wholesale) to T-shirt dresses ($40) — all cut in the designer’s signature languid style, with colors ranging from simple whites and heather grays to lavender, chartreuse and cerulean”. “ Necklines are stretched and armholes are strategically lowered so that it looks worn in, ” he explains. “ It’s like sleeping in a T-shirt and then wearing it the next day. It’s not this crisp little T out of the dryer. It’s draped and kind of wilted. ” What do you guys think? I’m sooooo for it! Just the image of his samples on the rack gave me goosebumps… *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

HINT: Her nickname is lettucecup…” When did they bury the hatchet, and why weren’t there (hidden) cameras around when this happened?

I’m going to the Coachella music festival in a of couple weeks and have no idea what to wear! I’m especially stressed out with the shoe situation. I expect to be on my feet for 12 hours (or more) at a time, but I don’t want to sacrifice looks for comfort. Please help!! Thanks…and I love your blog!” We love music festivals! The thing about Coachella is that you need to look good, feel comfortable, and wear durable (washable) shoes. We’ve decided to create two outfit choices with the same pair of rain boots in different colors. Best part? Every item is under $45! Happy Shopping!

                            "post_text_content": "June 1, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview At first glance, one might think that our latest interviewee must be an artist of some sort. On the contrary, 24 year old Diana is a marketing consultant with a flare for everything, well, fun! Don’t get us wrong, she oh so amazingly dabbles in graphic design (check out her work below), but imagine how exciting it would be to go to work with such a colorful colleague. Loves it. Take a look at what this fab Jakarta native has to say and then head on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: Diana, we think that if anyone should have an outfit post blog, it should be you. We love how you manage to surprise us almost daily with your unique outfit combos. How much work does it take? Diana: Everyday is a new day to explore on fashion. I don’t think it requires that much of effort and even cash, just our willingness to pause for a moment and try to figure out different ways on wearing the same clothes. Chic Intuition: Seems like you don’t really follow the major trends, rather opting to create trends of your own. Why so? Diana: Trend for me is just a fresh breeze of what’s new at the moment, not a rule that dictates us what is to wear and whatnot. It’s hard for me to determine what’s actually in or out or accept said guides from so-called fashionistas, because I basically enjoy fashion as art and art is very personal. Chic Intuition: Sometimes we find similarities between your style and Harajuku Japanese street style. Quirky colored leggings, mismatched top and pants, and over-sized accessories. We love! Who/what inspires you? Diana: Japanese street style serves as a very good example of how dressing up can be (and should be!) so fun, and I admire them for that! I am inspired by the Harajuku Japanese, in the sense that I try to have as high of confidence as they have. I’m such a random person, and I often have so much random ideas..randomness is my inspiration 😀 Chic Intuition: In Indonesia, are people as accepting of your unique taste? Diana: Sometimes they are, sometimes they’re not. I do often get confused stares, but you could always stare them back, right? ;p Chic Intuition: We’ve noticed that you’ve recently started dabbling in styling. Any future plans in such an occupation (even though you work in marketing–please correct us if we’re wrong). Diana: I’d love to have a clothing line one day, but without the sacrifice of my main job in the corporate world. I love juggling between those two different worlds Chic Intuition: Finally philosophical question time, how colorful is too colorful? Diana: When too much fun brings you no good *Images courtesy of dianarikasari.blogspot.com and poop-art.deviantart.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Even though neither of us were born in the 1960s, we find the designer’s retro aesthetic completely close to home. Known for looking into the past for some inspiration, and basing her collections on color, color, and more color, Milly’s Michelle Smith decided to take another route this season . She said that “basing a whole collection around the color black felt really fresh and unexpected”, and we couldn’t agree more. *Images courtesy of style.com .

No it wasn’t the plot of the episode! Has anyone else noticed that absolutely nothing happens on that show? Well I have! Somehow though, I’m still hooked. Anyways, back to our story, so I was saying that I had something to think about… Oh ya! It was Lo’s gorgeous multi-ring necklace from the kitchen scene. I searched high and lo (no pun intended) for the exact same one and still haven’t figured it out. I did, however, find a very similar and equally hot version. It’s the Yochi Multi Ring Necklace and I’m sure you’ll agree that it’s a nice piece of bling. What do you guys think? *Images courtesy of mtv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I found a similar pair [at Ninewest] but I am wondering if you guys know of any other similar ones? Keep up the great work!” Ya Becky, the Edelman knock-offs seem to be a hit in the blogosphere, damn those Olsen twins! Everything they wear turns to (sale) gold! Ok so first off, we’d recommend trying eBay for the actual Edelmans (when we last check there were a few up for sale). There aren’t that many strikingly similar versions online, since the Balenciagas were such statement pieces. What we did find were a few wedged platform bootie options. How about trying the France Leather Platform Wedge by Bebe ? Or the Tapeet Lace Up Wedge Ankle Booties in patent or suede (our personal faves)? Hope we were helpful and happy shopping! *Images courtesy of their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

We Chics haven’t turned to drowning our sorrows over the economic condition by getting high… We’re talking about Little Sequin Dresses! It seems like for this upcoming spring season they’re all the rage and we wanted to let you guys in on the secret (if it’s still a secret anyways). I can imagine some of these pieces looking quite gorgeous under a simple neutral-colored blazer and since I myself have a gorgeous Marc Jacobs off-white colored one, I decided to search Net-A-Porter for a sequin counterpart to wear with it. Check out my faves below and maybe choose one for yourself. Whatever the case, make sure you have an LSD for the summer season. And, again, not the drug!

Appearing at the release party of her perfume in Manchester, she looked glamorous and divine walking down the red carpet.

The moment I saw the new Gossip Girl episode, I’ve had this question running through my mind! I asked around but none of my friends had the answer. Then I did my daily check on your blog and saw the dress in a post about the Jennifer Behr headbands. Do you know where I can find Blair’s yellow/green party dress?? THANK YOU!!!!!” Well Dana we do have the answer you need but somehow we have a feeling that you wont be satisfied. The dress is by Phillip Lim but is actually from his previous collection. This means that it’s sold out pretty much everywhere online. Your best bet is most probably on ebay. The dress is gorgeous! Too bad it took all of us seeing it on Blair to realize that… Sorry *Images courtesy of gossipgirlinsider.com and net-a-porter.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Love Rocks NY is a contemporary, fine jewelry collection from New York based designer Limor Ratzabi Senker. Her collection features ethically sourced micro-pave diamonds embedded in 14kt gold and platinum pendants, rings, earrings, and bracelets.

Everyone’s been giving a few sneak peak grained images of certain pieces, but now you can take a look at 4 whole outfits. With $30 lace cardigans in bold colors like mustard yellow and lingerie-inspired tulle slip dresses for only $40, this collection is sure to be a sell-out. Personally, I’m in love with the leopard belt that they’ve added to most outfits, so chic! We can’t give a full review till we’ve seen the items up close, but for now we think these images will do just fine. Mark your calendars: December 20! *Images courtesy of instyle.com .

With everything she’s famous for: prints, wrap dresses, and anything/everthing black & white, it screams “Take me with you on a tropical getaway!”. *Images courtesy of elle.com .

I have an unexplained love affair with shoes and the quirkier the better in my book. Well, what quirkier shoes are there than Charlotte Olympia? I have been coveting a pair for the past two years but keep getting sidetracked by other brands with better deals in terms of the price-point. Now that the Outnet is featuring Charlotte Olympia I think I will finally make the leap. The only question is which do I choose? Check out my faves below and head over here to get a pair of your own.

Especially if it actually is dreadful… So I know they named it that because it looks like a jacket made out of dreadlocks but, seriously, who thinks that a jacket made out of dreadlocks could be appealing in any minute way? The answer is MK and Ashley Olsen apparently and although we love love love their Elizabeth and James line this is one instant where they seem to have majorly dropped the ball! MK and Ashley, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? P.S. Check out the model, even she can’t hide how miserable she feels in her dread jacket!",

Well, most of the time the lines are pretty disappointing. The latest celebrity to hop onto the fashion designer bandwagon is Selena Gomez. We’re sure her line is aimed at her tween fans, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be stylish. When we saw the preview images on her models, all we could think of was that the clothes were…dated and mismatched. Selena claims that “ With my line, I really want to give the customer options on how they can put their own looks together. ” Wow, to us that seems like even more of a challenge for her fans, how can they put the looks together when non of the items match? Sorry Selena, we’re gonna have to pass. *Image courtesy of popsugar.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

If you can’t see that, you really don’t know anything about matching clothes. The one on the left doesn’t match as perfect as the right one, but it definitely matches. \nLesson 2: I’m just stating what should be the obvious (especially for people who DOES know about matching clothes) – a designer shouldn’t design something high fashion, that true fashionistas wear. A designer should design something that he/she finds awesome and maybe new that could become fashion. \nLesson 3: Real fashionistas know fashion, and don’t just go for the big names like Gucci and Luis Vuitton etc. Cause everything Gucci makes seems (by people who aren’t sure of what fashion is) high fashion, because it’s a big name. If Dream Out Loud became one of the biggest name/brand in the world, believe me you; you wouldn’t criticize it at all. 😉 \n— \nI think Selena Gomez’s clothing line is quite cool, but I’m definitely not gonna wear it like that.

Second row seats, a Bryan Boy spotting, and gorgeous clothing couldn’t have hurt either. The collection had a lot (and I mean a lot ) of thick knit scarves, innovative knitwear, and metallics. In other words, the collection was very ADAM and we must say we loved it. To sum it up, it made us want to skip over Spring and go straight to Fall! Check it out… *Images courtesy of style.com .

I go to your site religiously and I know you guys are magicians when coming to find items that people want, so I figured I’d give it a whirl. I am in love, IN LOVE with the dress Vanessa Hudgens wore to one of the HSM3 events, it was bananas. A white Calvin Klein mini with long sleeves. I was wondering if you guys can find something similar and for cheaper? Thanks so much!” We think you’ve come to the right place Emma, ’cause if you want it, but can’t afford it, we love looking for alternatives. Funnest task ever! We scoured the web and chose our top 3 picks for Vanessa’s look for less. Happy shopping!

A number of you have been avidly inquiring about Taylor Jacobson’s watch that she has been wearing episode after episode. We scoured all the images we could find, and it’s clear that she is wearing a personal fave: a Rolex Day-Date. Her specific model is actually vintage, since the Day-Date has gone under a mini makeover. We assume that Taylor’s watch is the 1974 President Day-Date in 18k Yellow Gold . You can find the actual watch on bid websites like eBay, just beware knock-offs. Now, we know that Taylor Jacobson is a famous stylist who works for the glorious Rachel Zoe and probably has a paycheck that anyone dreams of. So for you frugal fashionistas out there, we scoured the web for some much less pricey options. Happy Shopping!

She literally had a following as large as the unstoppable Kate Moss. But all that went down the drain, for unexplainable ( adulteress? ) reasons. All drama aside, she’s recently been spotted carrying the “Pompom Shoulder bag” by Tila March. And we think we fell in love with her all over again. The bag is the perfect answer to a fashionista seeking a bohemian vibe. It comes in a number of colors and retails for $765. Unfortunately it isn’t available online at this time, but if you’re interested we’d recommend visiting their official website . *Images courtesy of tilamarch.com and coolspotters.com .

                            "post_text_content": "October 26, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview Its been a while since we last posted a Chic Interview, but we promise our latest interviewee is worth the wait. Currently running around between NY and Cali, this bohemian blogger oozes talent. Twenty-seven year old Krystal Simpson is the girl to keep your eye on. With a stint on an MTV reality tv show, collaborations with a t-shirt designer and fashion label, and a knack for writing that leads to full on blog stalking, Krystal proves that talent can take you places. Read what she had to say below and then check out her inspiring blog . Chic Intuition: I’m going to start off by being quite honest about my first encounter with your blog. I stumbled upon a link in someone’s sidebar, and was in awe of the photography, let alone the exquisite, and honest, expression of words. But while I was scanning your blog, I couldn’t help but think “This girl looks damn familiar!?” A little Googling later, I realized the girl from ‘that Rolling Stone show on MTV’ had undergone a fashion transformation. New haircut, new makeup, new Krystal. What influenced the change? Krystal: That’s s flattering, thank you. But really, I change on a daily basis; I cut my hair all the time, and I’ve always collected vintage clothing, and been into fashion. When I was on the show [I’m From Rolling Stone], the focus was on writing, so they really didn’t show my love for the fashion world all that much. As for the new makeup thing, it is really more like the little to no makeup thing. Women are so beautiful with no extras, they don’t need all that camouflage to hide what they really look like every day. I just don’t understand that standard in the fashion world, women and makeup makes no sense. I just know what we are naturally is so far away from our perceived image, fashion sense, and style. Were just wearing our preferences, we are what we choose to be every day, why not have fun and change it up, or not–it’s all up to the individual. Chic Intuition: I’d like to think your blog is a form of artistic expression. How did you come up with the theme? Krystal: My favorite writing jobs have been the ones that allow me carte blanche, any time I have a restriction of any kind placed on my work, I tend to back away from it–now thankfully I don’t have to take those kinds of jobs at all. But I wanted my website to be a place to post anything and everything I could possibly dream up. The title “What is Reality Anyway” is double in meaning, both from my time on reality TV, but more-so from my love of quantum physics and the science of creating your own reality. I’ve been a writer for a while, and my mentor, the poet and writer Maria Garcia Tabor always encouraged me to start a blog in addition to my various writing gigs. I should have listened to her and started one years ago, knowing now how blogging is the future of publishing, and all the opportunities I’ve received just from having a blog. If I didn’t start a blog would I still have a jean with Quiksilver? A t-shirt? I’m quite thankful for all of it though, the dream continues. Chic Intuition: Music, music, and music. From the titles of your posts, one realizes how big a part it has in your life. Does it affect your style as well? Krystal: Oh yes, music was my first conscious style influence, the male rock stars specifically–they are just the coolest dudes, full of swagger, and could care less what anyone thinks about them. Why would you want to be the groupie when you can be the rock star? I love the toughness their fashion, all the boots, leather, the beading–those boys can wear women’s clothes the way I love to see them worn, a little bit ragged. I like things in fashion to be a little off, disheveled. Anything too perfect makes me want to mess it up before I can go on. I never walk around looking like a too girly porcelain doll, it just isn’t me to be cutesy like that. Teetering around on heels that really shouldn’t be made for any sort of healthy foot, and piling on makeup, hair, all that extra crap makes me nervous. Chic Intuition: Let’s not sidetrack here, how can we forget that you are a literary genius, prize winning poet and writer. What do words mean to you? Krystal: Words are great; so many different ones that mean the same thing, but they are all there to flow in prose, so beautiful that certain pieces can bring people to tears because of the way the writer captured a moment and expressed it. It really isn’t the words, it is their perceived meaning that hooks us. Chic Intuition: So we have to ask, how did you get to be on MTV, and did the experience of starring in a reality show help launch your career? Krystal: Basically I sent my writing samples in for the casting process, and after a few interviews that was it. And yes, of course being on TV helped my career, although I never had any set career. People probably think I was just on a TV show and that was it, but I’ve been writing for various papers and other publications since right after high school, and also done other things in fashion and photography. I never wanted to have real job, and I have done very well at not having one. I made a lot of great friends and business contacts when I did the TV show, and it opened a lot of doors. It was one of my dreams, to work for Rolling Stone, and the wave that followed it; going to Fashion Week, sitting front row at some shows, going to these crazy events. I mean, I am from a pretty small town, there is no grand events happening there, no fashion, nothing outside of the regular golf tournament, so I had always wanted to find out what else there was out there that was exciting and fresh. When I decided I wanted more, all my dreams came true in record time, I had to consciously conjure up new fantasies, since all the ones from my past came true. C hic Intuition: How does it feel to be immortalized on a t-shirt? Surreal? Krystal: The Ediot tee, I love her brand, it was so flattering, and of course surreal. I’m glad someone thinks I warrant that kind of display, haha! Chic Intuition: Finally, philosophical q time: If you had to choose one, would your rock or would you roll? Krystal: Hmm , I could get really deep and philosophical on this one and say that like consciousness and energy, they {rock and roll} are inextricably combined, and one simply couldn’t exist without the other. At least that’s how it goes in my world. *Images courtesy of whatisrealityanyway.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

People loved them, people hated them, and mostly people just questioned their existence. Love em or leave em, Steve Madden has created a similar version for a 6th of the price. Personally we prefer the heel of the Madden’s since, like many others, we felt the Maison’s made Rachel look like she had hooves for feet.

Don’t know her? She’s known for dressing her cute bunny sketch in the latest trends to go down the runway. First, she had a collaboration with Delia*s, where her drawings were immortalized on this and this tee. And now for winter, you can wear her drawings on sweatshirts available at Forever21 .

The trend started a few years back, and hasn’t budged off the fashion radar ever since. The great thing about cat eyes is that they compliment every eye shape, you just have to know how to carry out the liner. From red carpets to runways to real life, this look transcends perfectly in every situation. Take a look at our fave cat eye makeup and invest in a great liner to pull off the look yourself.

In this case the jewel we discovered (literally) is Michelle Chang Jewelry . She is a talented artist who actually makes the pieces herself and we must say that they are beautiful and suprisingly affordable. We had Michelle send over a few pieces for us to see in person and we definitely give it our quality seal of approval. Be prepared, though, that the pieces are quite delicate in size and that we would honestly go for the diamond pieces over the others. An added bonus? Michelle has so graciously offered our readers a discount for 15% off with the code: MCJ . Happy shopping people! P.S. Watch out for Michelle’s stuff in a supersecret project we’re currently working on. Oops! I think we may have said too much already…",

I always tend to get comments on my choice of rings from random people on the streets. That’s why when I saw these shell rings on Vivre I was blown away. My favourite is definitely the Coral and Shell Ring but with that price tag I may be able to get the same effect with either one of the other two. Check out my faves below and click away if you feel the same about these babies.

She managed to take a sexy Herve Leger dress and turn it into a business casual look with the addition of a simple blazer and a statement necklace. Since I still can’t get over her amazing look and how surprising it was that Tory Burch didn’t hire her, I find it only appropriate to attempt to recreate it.

Especially since her chosen muses are the the four main female characters on Gossip Girl! Now that’s a collection worth fighting for and the fact that you get it at a bargain is just an added bonus!

Each bottle was designed to symbolize what each label stands for, and we have to say that we’re dying to get our hands on a Missoni coke! I soooo have the outfit for it!

Since I’m growing out my bob, I decided to make a change and just bang it. I was so excited, I even contemplating taking the deed into my own hands. I mean, how hard can it be to cut off a measly few hairs in a horizontal line right? Wrong. I was on the brink of receiving a visit from my monthly friend, Miss P, and felt like I could do anything . Ladies, take my advice and don’t make any rash decisions when you are PMSing. Hormones somtimes act like your best friend, or your worst enemy. I starting googling ‘ celebrity bangs ‘ and even created a whole folder dedicated to my fave finds. I didn’t even know which image to choose, I just thought whatev, my hairdresser can pick whatever one she likes (or can pull off). That’s when I accidentally found this hilarious article (which I now can’t find for the love of God) that stated that if you’re on your period, just off a breakup, or going through any sudden psychological manifestation, you should steer clear of wanting bangs . It also stated that there’s much more drama involved with the upkeep of bangs than us bangless beauties can imagine (Scenario A: waking up with a cowlick on top of your forehead). I slowly started to think twice about my decision, and by the next morning I was so happy about not taking the plunge. So remember ladies, only make life altering decisions (aka cutting your bangs) when you are emotionally sober. But seriously do you still think I should get them? *Images courtesy of beauty.about.com, women-hairstyles.com, and coutureinthecity.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

It’s easier to clip back on days you don’t want them and will look natural if you decide to grow them out again.  If you feel bold, you can take the extra step and get the super blunt style!\nOh, and a few other things…don’t ever try cutting or trimming your own bangs unless you’re a hairdresser with professional shears.  It’s nearly impossible to get the clean lines and shaping with everyday shears and it WILL look obvious that you cut them yourself.  If your hair gets greasy, it will show more since you have hair that falls forward.  And I read you should avoid bangs if you have a very small face/forehead, because it will make all features seem to crowd to the center of the face.\nSorry for the long post, but I’ve had a love/hate relationship with my bangs most of my life!

But yeah; once in a while i wake up with a cowlick but i just brush my hair and it’s back to hotness.\nLast month I was kinda anxious and didnt have anything else to do and my bangs were huge and i couldnt really see so I though I should trim them myself. BIG MISTAKE! now they have a weird shape and they are not even straight or with some funky asymetric shape, they are hideous and my stylist didnt think of something to fix it because they were short so I am waiting them to grow now.\nI think bangs are great and can give you a more romantic or modern look depending on the type you go for and can help a lot on your face, but you really should check with your stylist and ask him/her if they would look good and which one works great for your face."

What a great take on the leather/denim combo jackets that everyone’s been wearing. Remember the Alexander Wang version that Taylor Jacobson has? Well I personally think this find is a better way to go, since you achieve a similar effect for better quality (the whole jacket is leather) in addition to it being for less! Don’t you just love the internet? If interested, hurry up and take a look at the Oasis Colour Blocked Leather Biker Jacket for $255. The perfect winter jacket in our opinion… *Images courtesy of its respective link. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Please help me find the exact pair, or possibly something similar to it! Thank you so much! “ Well Annie, it looks like you are in luck. At first we thought these babies must be either Moschino or Juicy, and yet they turned out to be by Chinese Laundry. Miss Hudgen’s loves a bargain and always dresses her age by opting for contemporary brands instead of stuffy premiere designers. These babies are the Sudoku Sandals and retail for about $69. A little bird also told me that you might be able to get a promo code for the site. Let me know how it goes so I can get myself a pair as well!

Rihanna: If only she toned down the shoulders to 50% of their ferocity, she would have avoided looking like a clown at a funeral. MK Olsen : We know its vintage. We know it’s Lacroix.

                            "post_text_content": "May 17, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview Our latest interviewee hails from ohsofaraway&fabulous Australia. Though twenty-one year old Dajana is a student, she can school anyone in the class of style. One look at her blog and you’ll be hooked to her edgy coolness, we guarantee. This Fashion Styling student is sure to have quite an impressive career in the future, and we’re willing to put our money on it. Take a look at our interview and then prance on over to her blog for more fun… Chic Intuition: Living in Australia, how does it feel having your seasons flipped with almost the rest of the world? Do you feel tired of the trends after seeing them online in other countries months before you get to wear them? Or does it work the other way around? Dajana: It does make me want winter when in Australia we are in the middle of summer and all I want to do is wear layers and all the new winter trends but in a way it’s also good because I get to see what i will be wearing before hand, I get inspired so when winter arrives here I already know what I want to be wearing. Chic Intuition: Ok, so what’s with the bowler hats? You sure can work them! Dajana: Haha, that’s so weird you even ask that because I just got my first hat two weeks ago, I used to just borrow my brothers for some of the photos I took. I was never really a hat person at all but I’m really liking it now! I don’t think the hats I have been wearing are bowler though, bowler hats are more circle and smaller. Chic Intuition: Diet coke for breakfast? Please elaborate . Dajana: On that day I happened to grab a mini diet coke can from the fridge and I just ran out the door to do whatever, so when I was taking photos that day I had the can with me and it was visible in the photos so I thought I might add it to the post. But obviously you should eat something along with the diet coke people! Chic Intuition: Online shopping: annoying or awesome? Dajana: I love it. So addictive. There’s just something about browsing online and then confirming your order and waiting patiently for the mail man every day. So much more exciting than going to the store. Who doesn’t love receiving packages? Chic Intuition: For someone looking into starting a blog, what advice would you give them. Ours would be: don’t underestimate the time/effort it takes to get a blog rolling. Dajana: I totally agree with your advice, it does take a lot of time and effort. People ask me this a lot actually and most people are just hurrying to get more followers, to get noticed, to get free things…but seriously that shouldn’t be your main reason for starting a blog. You can’t get sucked into all that. Just start slow, post original content, things you love and want to share with others, there are so many blogs out today and everyone is posting the same photos, be different, stand out. Enjoy it! Chic Intuition: We have to admit that we have a huge obsession with Aussie designers. What kills us is they don’t get the recognition they deserve. Why do you think that is? Dajana: You know I think these days they are getting a lot more recognition than what they used to get. Which is great. There are so many amazing Australian designers out there and they should be getting way more recognition but i think it’s already happening. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time. How torn and worn is too torn and worn? Dajana: If it’s falling apart at the seams and making you look like a homeless dude it’s probably time to chuck it out. *Images courtesy of leflassh.com .

Don’t believe us? Check out exhibit A where Miss Olivia Palermo pairs a pair of leather leggings with a gorgeous military topper and an unexpected shoe pairing of grey booties. Now, head left towards exhibit B where she pairs some green leather shorts with a plaid top and black opaque tights and pumps. The result is absolutely shocking and definitely not in a good way. In any sense, one should proceed with caution when attempting the leather short by pairing it with a very feminine blouse in a complimenting color. A plaid shirt, however, takes the outfit to the country look you are trying to avoid in the first place! Not only that, but the fact that they’re bright green???? Come on! Well since you always look so good Olivia, we’ll give you a pass. Everyone is allowed a fashion flub once or twice in their lives right? *Images courtesy of thefashionspot.com .

Well come this Spring, you’ll be able to tote around your stud love in a new range of eye popping colors. I got to see some of the Fall models up close and personal, and I have to tell you that the pictures hardly do them justice. I actually messaged Chic Critic about my awe, the size of the bags are TDF ( to die for dahlings!) and the leather is so soft and supple. Now that we can get them in brighter shades for the hotter days, well that makes us even merrier. If you’re lucky enough to have a Nordstrom ‘s near you, we’d recommend a visit since the colors are exclusively sold there, or just check them out online.

We are dying over both the boots featured here. We honestly feel like if someone took a picture of us staring at shoes we’re admiring, we’d totally look like the model below: beautifully in awe ( so confident huh? ). The shoes featured are the Sappheir and Donley . Both ship out late September, and we’d recommend pre-ordering them if interested since they’ll probably be flying off the cyber racks after this ad comes out. *Image courtesy of nitrolicious.com .

Is it worth putting the big bucks down for a sweater/top/skirt/bag?..you get where we’re going. So it’s no wonder large labels decided to steer towards the road not taken and skip the ‘designer prices’. Following in some huge names, comes the latest to create a diffusion line, Richard Chai. ‘Love’, as he calls it, is a collection that is geared for the sporty girl in us who wants to get ready in mere minutes and look fab. Mr. Chai, we’ve just added your items to our Spring wardrobe must-haves. *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Again, bravo Nicole for creating a celebrity designed line that’s actually wearable and very inspired. Can’t wait for those pieces to be available because I know for sure I will have more than a piece or two of Winter Kate in my spring wardrobe! P.S.

The Rachel Zoe Project Season 3 premeire’s tonight, August 3rd, and we’re sure it slipped some of your minds, ours included ( come on! We have a gazillion things to do these days ). But now that you know we’re sure you’ll tune in tonight at 10/9c on BRAVO. Love her or hate her, Rachel Zoe is back and as always, she is bringing the fashion and the drama with her! Starting the star-studded season off with a photo shoot for A-lister Demi Moore, the team finds themselves having a lot of trouble keeping their act up when Taylor is let go. As expected, the next-in-line Brad is then promoted, but will be he able to handle his new responsibilities? And will the team be as strong without Taylor around? Woah, can anyone sense the bitterness? “When Taylor is let go” ?! We thought she stated that she quit? Ok, more of a reason to watch!",

I can literally go to the mall looking for clothes and end up with a new pairs of shoes. When it comes to designer shoes, I justify the price by looking for footwear that can only be described as a work of art. Enter these AMAZING YSLs! As soon as I spotted them in one of Tommy Ton’s Fashion Week shots I knew it was love. Unfortunately, the exact Venice Leather Sculpted Wedges are only available in gold. Fret not, these similar Totem Sued Sculpted Wedges come in black! Either way, it’s the shape of the wedge that makes them so cool… *Image courtesy of style.com .

I would like to know what hairstyles are in style for the Fall and what hair colors are in as well.” For Fall it’s all about easy versatility. The most popular trends we spotted on the runways? Either pixie short or totally boho long. Hair was always tousled, so it seems like the ‘out of bed’ look is back. If you don’t want to take the plunge with a shorter do, and you still haven’t reached length-worthy locks, then try the high bun for some easy fun (especially if you’re donning a scarf). As for color, we recommend toning it down to some darker roots appropriate for the cooler weather. Good luck ladies! *Images courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Please help me..” So we know that the recession is hurting even the best of us out there, and $600 dollars for a bag might be a bit steep for some. Well, as usual, Chic Intuition will come to your rescue and we always have the answers! Don’t you think this Sabina Simone Satchel is a dead ringer for the original Dylan tote?! And for less than half of the price, we say buy away Cindy!! ( We know we rock, no need for applause thank you… ) P.S. It also comes in a really cute pink color for the summer.

His name is Dylan George, and we have to admit that we’re falling for him too. No, he’s not the latest Twilight movie character, but a brand of distressed denim! Got you there, didn’t we?! Either way, we think this label’s a keeper, and can’t wait to get our hands on a pair. The great thing about these jeans is that they’re torn to perfection, not too sleazy and not too minimal. You can dress them up or down, depending on your mood and the occasion. The perfect pair? We think so! Get them here . *Image courtesy of singer22.com .",

I had just gotten myself a gold one from a trip to Lebanon, and my younger sister spotted it and wanted one (suddenly a wave of guilt went over me, why didn’t I buy her one as well?!). So I was determined to go on an online witch hunt and track a similar one down. I was pleasantly suprised when I spotted the Jennifer Zeuner Mini Hamsa Diamond Bracelet , and for the fraction of the price I had bought mine! So I obviously took the plunge and ordered one for sis. Little did I know that some of our fashion mentors (Whitney Port, Vanessa hudgens, Lauren Conrad, and Rachel Zoe) were huge fans of the label!

Talk about perfecting the mis-match. I never would have consciously thought to pair natural leather booties with a gray bag. But seems like the muted colors of her outfit allow the otherwise clashing tones to pass this style test with flying colors! Her hot hand-candy is the Celine Watch Me Work bag that retails for $2,100. And get this: her shoes are by Nine West! They’re called Iceblue and go for $109. Applause for the wardrobe stylists! *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

We absolutely loved the yellow, the paillettes, and the chunky sweaters. The handbags and shoes designed by Taylor herself were also a huge hit. Will they be on the market?

But before I go, I have to let them know who is the divine one (lol). I need to know what is in for fall/ winter 2008/2009″ Good question. Although we’ve been postings tidbits about what to expect for the Fall, we felt like Andrea’s question was a good time to mesh together all of our fave upcoming trends. Take a look at what’s in, and realistically achievable on a college student’s budget, for this upcoming season. *Images courtesy of style.com , net-a-porter.com and facehunter.blogspot.com .

We know that “to each her own”, but people, when one is trashy and the other is trendy it just gets us thinking… Does one never tell the other what she thinks of her outfit? I mean, if my sister were to leave the house in, lets say, neon hot pants, I’d literally force her to take them off. Now, if she was wearing a tasteless dress, I’d politely convince her into an outfit change. Only makes us wonder (and actually come to the conclusion): Does Nicky Hilton secretly hate Paris?

I mean, if I’m going to wear one, why not give it a little companion? These days, I find it harder to abide by my natural instinct and pair my rings together, since my morning ritual consists of running through the door with whatever jewelry I can grab while balancing my coffee in the other hand. So I finally came to the conclusion that, ‘ hey maybe I should purchase a double finger ring’ and just make it that much easier? Take a look at our top picks for double finger rings: Erica Anenberg Double Finger Ring $280 Bing Bang Arrow Two Finger Ring $215 Iwona Ludyga Design Double Rock Ring $130 Boucheron Double Ring $2,450 *Images courtesy of their respective links and shutterstock.com.

The clothing struck us as something a demented woman of the 50s would wear, one who dreams of flowers and spiders, sunsets and hurricanes. So it was no surprise when we read that Cynthia said the concept was “ something that’s both scary and pretty “. The blurry fabrics, the unpredictably slashed dresses and skewed bangs all pointed to her theory, and we are eating it up. Once again, great job Cynthia. *Images courtesy of style.com .

At my thinnest, when i was running 4-6 miles a day and eating a steady 1400 calories a day, i was a size 10. and you could see my ribs. Women come in all shapes and sizes and as a woman yourself, you should be more supportive of women who are proud to show off their curves, not afraid to have a little cellulite and above all else, LOVE THEIR BODIES! Geeze, ya know, when other women put curvy women down, you try to pin on them a value or a label. Its just as bad as a sexist boss, or a racist or when our mothers used to tell us our legs were “looking a little thicker these days.” \nThere are TON of guys i know who would look at her and say she is sexy, but we women are so obsessed with what “sexy” means to us. Sexy should be about how you feel, not how you look. As women, fighting the insecurities we have because we’ve let the media tell us what is beautiful instead of our families and our husbands or partners… WE are ridiculous, and you, dear woman, need to get a grip and go eat a big juicy cheeseburger. Fashion is indeed for everyone and we need to rid ourselves and the business we support of plus-size prejudice.\nThat model is gorgeous, and i bet she got a HELL of a paycheck. GOOD FOR HER!\nAnd may I add, it might make you uncomfortable because you’re insecure enough with yourself that if YOU looked like that, you wouldnt find yourself attracive. Work on yourself. you’re beautiful at any size im sure!"

We were just discussing their glorifying nature of design, for those lucky enough to afford their products. For the rest of us out there? Let’s just say thank the Almighty for Zara, H&M, and other outlets. We’re able to wear the trends of this season for prices that won’t deduct our bank statements for seasons to come. Our latest obsession? Balmain Zipper Booties . We know not everyone can afford to drop $1,495 on a pair of booties, so we went looking for a version 1/5th the price . We screamed hallelujah when we saw these Pour La Victoire Women’s Adriane Bootie . They come in 3 hot shades: black, red, and gray. Happy shopping! *Images courtesy of their respective links.

A lot when she’s designing a fashion line for hip label Topshop . We’ve been reviewing it every season, and weren’t really wowed by anything. But we always gave her the benefit of the doubt, and selected a few of our faves. On the other hand, this season is like no other. Why may you ask? Well, Ms Moss has chosen to take her inspiration from… a nursing home! ( We kid, we kid ). But honestly, after taking a look at the awful line, the only thing that comes to our minds is that grandmas everywhere will stand tall and proud, and might even purchase a few pieces if they’d fit. Representing the elderly in your fashions is a yes, but trying to sell them to 20 year old fashionistas is a MAJOR NO ! Blech… *Images courtesy of topshop.com and thesimpsons.com.

While browsing my ‘archives’ as I like to call them (think early 2000s) I stumbled on a pair of studded light wash bell bottom jeans. I must say that I was absolutely thrilled that they fit me considering that I was about 18 when I bought them. The fact that I just had a baby may have turned the volume of happiness up a notch. With that feeling of overwhelming pride, I had a strong desire to wear them out of the house and am happy to say that I finally can. Flares are back baby and are expected to be the hit silhouette for the summer. I actually feel confident enough to deem them the ‘new skinnies’.

I have a question regarding those lace up ankle boots I’ve been seeing around numerous fashion blogs and also saw Kate Moss sporting. Where can you buy a pair that wont hurt my pocket? Thanks and more power to Chic Intuition!” So Janna can we safely assume that you’re talking about the Minnetonka Boots? If that’s the case, then don’t despair! There are many versions of these popular shoes online. To start off, the actual Minnetonka’s aren’t that expensive, especially the ankle length version at $44.95! You can get them here .

                            "post_text_content": "December 3, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview The daughter of an ex-fashion model and designer who gave it all up to raise her two girls, Jane Aldrige is living and breathing proof that sometimes fashion is just in your blood. A self-professed shoeaholic, and trust me when I say shoeaholic, Jane takes you into a fantasy world that all us fashionistas would kill to live in even just for a day. Between her and her mom, this girl has almost every IT shoe ever made and knows how to wear them with style. Being a shoe addict myself, I find Jane’s blog Sea of Shoes extremely addictive and can’t wait to see what she’ll come up with next. Also, the rare cameos made by Jane’s equally stylish and beautiful mom definitely makes for an added treat. Check out what Jane had to say about her love of shoes, her mother, and her eternal ramen noodle eating existence and prepare to fall in love… Chic Intuition: Let’s start off by saying we love your style and your insanely amazing shoe collection. Being a shoe-aholic myself, I find it difficult to stop sometimes. How do you know when you’ve reached your shoe-buying limit? Jane: Ramen for a week straight. Chic Intuition: How old were you when you started your love affair with shoes? Jane: I have to say that my love affair with shoes really started when I was old enough to wear them-I got my first pair of heels for my 15th birthday. But vintage cowboy boots were my first shoe obsession, that started when I was about 12. My grandma and grandpa run a business selling cowboy boots on eBay so they would always find awesome boots for me. Chic Intuition: What inspired you to start blogging about your footwear obsession? Jane: Blogs are a great way to connect with the fashion world-living in Small Town, TX thats something thats hard for me to do! I was definitely inspired by blogs like Style Bubble and Kingdom of Style-I never had thought of a blog as a creative outlet for my love of fashion. Chic Intuition: After reading that you were a junior in high school and seeing what you wore to one of your free dress days, we just have to know how your peers react to your outrageous outfits? Jane: I think I’m regarded around school as an eccentric figure-people find my outfits entertaining, and I get lots of compliments about my shoes. When I wore a Comme des Garcons skirt over jeans my friends wanted me to take it off so they could try it on. Chic Intuition: From your blog, we were able to deduce that your mom was a former model/fashion designer. Obviously, fashion is in your blood and so we must ask – how has your mother’s style influenced your own? Jane: My mom is the best shopping buddy. I am grateful to have been able to learn so much about the fashion industry from her-she also has an astounding knowledge of vintage clothing and is particularly skilled when it comes to scouring thrift stores and eBay for fabulous vintage designer pieces. My mom has fabulous style-this week she has been wearing vintage 501’s everyday with random thriftstore jackets and crazy over-the-top shoes. Every day she has on a new combination of jacket and shoes-it’s been very fun to watch the evolution of her intechangable wardrobe. Chic Intuition: Being known to be a little ‘out there’ with our fashion choices, we pale in comparison to you. How do you get over the nervousness of taking a risk with such bold fashion choices? Jane: Hahaha! I guess I never think too much about being “out there”-sometimes people tell me I look outrageous, and I’m like, “Really? Why?” I see clothes as what they are: clothes! I can’t really differentiate a pencil skirt and a tutu in terms of outrageouness. When you live in a happy little fashion bubble like I do, you don’t think too much about how your outfits are percieved by other people. Chic Intuition: We are so sorry for making you choose (we know we’d have a hard time with it ourselves) but who is your favourite fashion/shoe designer and why? Jane: Since you’re making me choose I’m going to have to break it down. Margiela for clothes-the most directional designer and Dries van Noten for shoes-consistently well designed and there is always a pair of Dries I lust for season after season. Dries is definitely my stand-by. Not to mention his are the most comfortable shoes. Chic Intuition: Do you plan to study something fashion related when you graduate from high school? Jane: Definitely! I can’t wait to live a life consumed by fashion-it’s what I love. I love it so much that it’s hard for to narrow down what field of fashion I would like to be a part of–but something along the lines of being an editor, stylist, or brand consultant might be the direction that I’m heading. Chic Intuition: Where do you usually shop for shoes and what’s the most you’ve ever spent on one pair? Jane: Barney’s is usually a good connect for a lot of my favorite designers-but sometimes I’ll score good pairs on eBay or order from Browns Fashion. I’m learning to be more resourceful when it comes to finding exactly the pair of shoes I want-I’m squandering my first paycheck on my #1 pair of shoes for Spring 09. As for how much I’ve spent on one pair-let’s just say Ramen was [the] main food group in my household for a very long time. Chic Intuition: Lastly, a philosophical question, how high is too high? Jane: As high as you’d like-without dislocating your hips that is.",

If you haven’t seen Tommy’s work before, you can check it out at jakandjil.com . Honestly, I think it’s a great move. Tommy’s style and attention to detail is unique and really gives another angle to the sometimes redundant typical street style photos. Instead, he zooms in his camera to certain details that reall make the picture pop! Check out some of his work from London Fashion Week so far… *Images courtesy of style.com .

Filled with a lot of off-the-shoulder crop tops, acid-wash bodysuits, and powder-pink mesh leggings ( knee length, which we thought were gorge ), the show was a thumbs up in our books. The designer best summed it up herself, “It’s classical meets street”. We thought this was a huge departure for the line, which showed great promise and talent.

If you, like us, crave the attention sometimes than you’re bound to get it with this look. Cat eye amped up to the max with creamy eyeshadow is the perfect accessory for a night out. Just keep the rest of the face to an extreme bare minimum. We’d recommend using a shadow all over your lids, and topping it off with a dab of Vaseline for extra shine. Yep, all the pros use this drugstore jelly for extra shine. Try this MAC Pigment Eyeshadow in Bloodline .

The site actually called them Ray Bans, which I knew immediately that they were not. I see no signature Ray Ban [logo] on the side, and they are not the Wayfarers that everyone seems to be wearing these days. So all I have to say is HELP! Thank you so much” Ok, so we have to give you props for IDing the sunnies as not being Wayfarers, since they look quite similar to them. The fact that the frames are a bit larger and more rounded than the classic model of Ray Bans clued us into their brand. If we had to guess, we’d say that Ashley’s red sunglasses are by Super. The specific model is called ‘Zeiss Rock Hard’ and retails for $128. You can purchase them here . Chic choice Priscilla! *Images courtesy of tobi.com and imageshack.us .

Well, I know I can always rely on you guys to help me find it or at least an alternative!!! I love the black jacket on Mary Kate Olsen and gotta have it! Thanks ahead, you ladies never fail me!” Thanks sweetie! We’d be fools not to recognize this jacket since our readers ask us about it soo much. So don’t worry, we’re sure its a Rick Owens. Only problem? It’s from a few years ago, so the exact model isn’t available. But if we know one thing about Owens, it’s that he takes his basic cowl neck asymmetrical leather jacket and designs variations season to season, that’s why they’re so worth the investment. So you can either try this Rick Owens Drkshdw Cowl Neck Jacket that retails for $1,373 ( and for TODAY ONLY, use code SSENSECM for 30% off!!! ) or this Rick Owens Blistered Side Zip Leather Jacket . Too high for your budget? Then why not try this almost identical Veda Max Classic Leather Jacket that goes for $660! Phew!

She’s not one to shy away from accessories, and the fact that “The collection is targeted at girls in their teens to women in their 30s who admire her, and the prices range from $30 to $150.” got us even more amped. Before we go any further, we want to point out that the line isn’t due to release until November, in Kitson stores and shopkitson.com , but till then, take a look at these teasers (and bring a pair of magnifying lenses if you want to follow our lead)! *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com .

What I like about the line is that it has a very cohesive vision and strong direction. It’s obvious that Nicole Richie focused on a Hippie/Tribal Chic aesthetic for her line and she’s really sticking to it. The shoes are a natural extension of her jewelry line full of hippie headbands and leather pieces. We also have no doubt that the clothing line will have a similar feel. Here’s to one celebrity whose designs are not a publicity stunt but a labor of love! Bravo Nicole! Can’t wait to see more! *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com and nicolerichie.celebuzz.com .

I have Prom coming up and I would like some pointers on how to give my dress a modern chic look instead of a boring traditional look. I got a strapless above the knee BEBE dress in black. Hope u can help!” Well the typical option would be to pair your dress with some pumps, a corsage, and walk out the door. But as a Chic Intuition reader, we know you can’t just look like the rest of the girls, and would love to up the chic factor! We have a couple of options for accessorizing your outfit, that we guarantee will garner some stares. Try an unexpected embellished cropped vest, like the leather Matthew Williamson for H&M one we featured above, or add a pop of color with a bright belt. You can also try to stand out with a bold hair accessory, like the headbands that Forever21 have. Finally, how about donning a sequined blazer for a Parisian chic look? Whichever way you go, please do update us with your choice and how it went. But most of all, remember that confidence is the best accessory out there, and just let loose and have a ball! *Images courtesy of forever21.com, net-a-porter.com, bebe.com, handm.com, and nordstrom.com.

Now, instead of adapting to one style genre and making it ‘ you ‘, we actually have the privilege of playing around with whatever direction we feel like going for the day, and we think we have Alexa Chung to thank for that. Just take a look at her outfit choices through her short-lived MTV show ‘ It’s on with Alexa Chung ‘ and tell us what you think. Isn’t she rocking it in every look? Gotta love you some Chung… *Images courtesy of mtv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

One of them just got back from a trip to NY, and lo and behold she had a gift for me! Yaay! I l.o.v.e gifts, but what I love more is when I actually am head over heels about it. Yes, the Chic Freak is not easily impressed, so kudos to her! Check out the necklace, it’s bling-tastic! I mean, it dresses up a simple tee, or can be worn with a great dress. Love the versatility, it’s made of rhinestones, chains, ropes, beads, and chunky hotness by Henri Bendel . Thanks Nono! Much love :* Oh, and check out my sick photography skills, using my French Vogue as a prop… I know, I know, I’m so talented, huh?! *Image courtesy of Chic Freak.

Personally I’ve been doing the pastel smokey eye for years and especially love it for those hot summer nights and paired with a tan. Easy to achieve is also a plus. Just choose any pastel shadow and apply generously around your upper and lower lashes and make sure to line your eyes with a black pencil and top it off with some black mascara. There you have it, a surefire way to update your look for spring! *Images courtesy of elle.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

I adore Vanessa Hudgen’s style and when I saw these outfits I thought they were so nice, but I don’t know what brand the clothes is or where the sandals are from! Please help me find it, or possibly something similar to it! I especially love the sandals!!” Well Nikoline, just by looking at the image you sent, it’s difficult to identify Vanessa’s top. However, we have previously been able to identify her purse and the sandals were a breeze. These babies are the Twelfth Street Luella Wedge in Black and judging by how many times I spot them around town daily, they are definitely the IT-shoe of the summer. If you want to recreate the look, just add an oversized black and white plaid shirt to these babies and you’re all set. Hope this helps!",

Maybe because her hand is resting on her chest so closely to it or maybe because it’s the one accessory that seems so rough against her soft demeanor. Either way, we love it.

Although her last collection was leaning on the matronly side, the summer pieces are absolutely on the mark! I am especially in love with the fringe sleeved blazer. One word- Droooooooooooooooooool!

I read it on a daily basis and am sure you can help me with this. Ever since I saw this picture of Hilary Duff on her way into a basketball game I haven’t been able to get her shoes out of my mind. Do you have any idea who they’re by and where I can get my hands on a pair? ” Thanks so much Angela for the sweet comments! Actually, we can help you with this dilemma and recognized the shoes right away. The are the LANVIN Sunbeam Pumps and they are absolutely stunning. To be honest, we would wait for the snakeskin ones to go on sale since they are a little pricey at $1900 but you can always go for the regular ones that Duff is wearing at $1000 a pop. Either choice, we wholeheartedly support you! Happy Shopping *Image courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Aside from her weak acting rep, the girl is doing something right. Maybe like finally simmering down from the nightlife schedule she used to worship, and actually have time to eat a bite? Take a look at her Elle cover from a few years back, the dead eyes and extremely slim figure seem like representations of her dark past, but judging from her healthy image on HB, we see a bright future for this starlet. Go nutritional meals!! “I was going to clubs all the time, and it was not okay. I was so alone. It made me not focus on what I was doing . . . I was living here [at the Chateau Marmont] for almost two years. Who blows that much money on a hotel? I could have bought a house! I did it to myself, and I have to deal with the consequences. I’m thankful for what I can take out of it. Now I feel clear. That’s my past, and I’m a different person now. I have goals and I’m working to achieve them. I’m not hanging out with people who are out every night getting f-ed up. And — I think that I’m happy.” *Images courtesy of elle.com and popsugar.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

So much so that we actually started planning which pieces we’d purchase as soon as the episode was over! Lucky for us, since the episode is filmed months in advance, we don’t have to wait much longer to make that dream a reality. On September 12 from 8-11pm, the Rachel Zoe for QVC line will officially be launched. In addition to the gorgeous faux fur vests, the line also boasts jewelry, handbags, and scarves.

So it was no surprise when we heard that she would be exclusively partnering up with Bebe for a couple of hot pieces of metal. I mean, this girl is on the go! First we hear about her shoe line , then that her clothing line will be coming out soon, and now this? Take a look at her House of Harlow esque pieces for less that she created exclusively for the store. Remember her Black Resin Necklace that goes for $125? Now you can get the duplicate created by Richie herself for $65!!! That’s a bargain if you ask us.

Now, let me explain that I wasn’t really fond of this Alexander Wang vest on the mannequin, until I saw LL donning it. Maybe it’s because every since retailer felt the necessity to zip it up for display purposes on their websites. Now Lindsay, on the other hand, wears it free-flowingly open, which we love. The cut and model really do show on her, and I found myself gearing to take the bite and just purchase it, that is until I noticed my size was sold out everywhere . Ugh, I hate the internet. Spot one celeb wearing something, and it’s off limits by the next morning. I guess I’ll just have to settle for this Topshop version.

                            "post_text_content": "August 3, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview M ost 15 year olds are out partying or at the mall with their greatest achievement being an A on their latest math test. Not Kristin of prim. magazine. At 15, she is the founder and editor of her own fashion magazine with a recent viewership count of just under 130,000. In addition to seeing her cutting edge layouts and edgy designs in print, she has also had the honor to interview the likes of Rad Hourani. prim. is a publication which strives to showcase only the most cutting edge in fashion, music, and art and for her work, Kristin has been featured in French Glamour, Italian Elle, and Teen Vogue among others. On top of all that, she is absolutely beautiful and, in our humble opinion, mature well beyond her years. Check out our interview with Kristin below then head over to her amazing magazine here and prepare to be just as hooked on her as we are. Chic Intuition: Let’s start by saying we are absolutely dumbfounded. After seeing your magazine we were extremely impressed and the fact that you’re only 15 blew us away! What motivated you to start your own magazine at such a young age? And how did you get anyone to take you seriously? Kristin: I have always been driven by aesthetics; I am an absolute perfectionist when it comes to my image and how things look. For this reason, fashion and art began to consume my life. Instead of studying for math and science I found myself endlessly flipping through my abundant supply of fashion/art magazines. The idea to begin my own magazine came to me about a year and a half ago and I decided to run with it. It was a complete shot in the dark but it began to come together within a few months. At first no one took me seriously. I would tell people I ran a publication and their responses would be “that’s nice” or “aw, that’s cute.” I think as prim. began to really make its way around the web (and the print versions around the world) did people begin to realize I was absolutely taking it as seriously as anything. Chic Intuition: Do you spend most of your free time working? If so,ever long to drop the responsibility of running your own magazine to go out and party like other kids your age? Kristin: Well I think it is a misconception that I don’t have time to be with my friends. I don’t run the whole entire magazine myself; people write the articles, book the interviewees, find retailers, etc. I design the layouts and OK everything that is put on the pages. This does allow me to have a social life, which I do love. Sure sometimes I cannot go out because I am required to fulfill my responsibilities at prim., but it is actually pretty rare that I have to decline an invitation to do so. Chic Intuition: You attended your first fashion week this year. What was it like?Details please! Kristin: Attending NY Fashion Week was absolutely amazing! I got to sit front row at a number of shows and attend those which I never dreamt of ever seeing in person like Ports 1961 and Charlotte Ronson. At different points in the week I found myself sitting across from or next to the likes of Anna Wintour and Lindsay Lohan. I am pretty sure I attended around twenty shows throughout the week, but was unable to be there one full day because of a family obligation. It killed but I had to do it. Chic Intuition: Now to the fashion, we absolutely loved your latest issue! What was it like to score an interview with Rad Hourani? Kristin: Rad is an absolute genius; I was floored when he agreed to do an interview with prim. As a matter of fact I guess he liked the issue too because he invited us all to attend his fashion presentation for his diffusion line, Rad by Rad Hourani. It took place on the 28th here in NYC and it was amazing. You can check my blog for a first look at the collection. He truly is a master of his craft. Chic Intuition: Describe your personal style for our readers. Do you feel that you are now under pressure to always look good ever since you became an editor of a fashion magazine? Kristin: I definitely am a fusion of different styles, a little grunge and a little boho. I love studs, leather, lace, black, white, grays, etc. As a source recently described, a “perfect fusion of Alice Dellal and Mary-Kate Olsen” which I like very, very much. Being a magazine editor definitely did put a little pressure on the way I dressed, but not much really. I have always had to leave the house looking absolutely perfect so I don’t feel the pressure as much. Chic Intuition: What are this season’s top trends? Kristin: I definitely see a ton of harem pants, blazers, fringing, feathers, and pleats. I never follow trends; I don’t walk into stores looking to buy what’s “hot” so I often find myself being lost in a world of trendiness. I am surely not an expert when it comes to trends. Chic Intuition: What’s one trend that you think should be completely wiped off the face of the fashion world? Kristin: I hate neon. I saw a lot of it scattered here and there throughout various collections and I think the whole world would just do better without it simply because most people do not know how to wear it. I never wear neon; I don’t enjoy bright colors much at all. Chic Intuition: With running a fashion magazine already under your belt, where do you see yourself 10 years from now? Kristin: Hopefully still at prim., only it being ten times the size it is now. Chic Intuition: Finally, philosophical question time. How prim. is too prim.? Kristin: prim. is definitely a fashion magazine with edge. prim. being too prim. would be trying too hard to look edgy either by overdoing studs, leather, repeating shapes, or patterns. No one likes a poser.",

I’ve always loved the style of Miss Trish of Capri and yet the price tag always held me back. Well worry no more! These babies that she’s created for Target are all for $29.99 and I’m strongly considering buying them all. Is that bad??? Hmmm… probably defeats the idea of recession chic no? Anyways, I have until April 5th to decide so until then, which of these do you plan to buy? *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Well consider yourselves lucky to be let in on this little secret before it becomes a full-fledged phenomenon. We’re talking about Richard Ruiz and his gorgeous Egyptian-inspired ‘Hours Collar’ pieces. Being of Egyptian decent, myself, I am absolutely in love with them! My personal fave is the Hours Collar Winged Top in Black but the celebs sure seem to be digging the Hours Collar Seduction Sheath Dress… Whichever you choose, we are confident that you will look hot and get a lot of questions about your outfit.

We recieve tons of emails on a daily basis asking us about her necklace, her top… pretty much anything she’s wearing! The research usually takes quite awhile but if we must say so ourselves we’ve been quite successful. The latest piece to create an email storm is the layered turquoise necklace that Taytay has been donning quite a bit in the past few episodes. We tweeted Taylor (God how we love twitter ) and were able to get a response: “Its vintage!” – Taylor Jacobson Unfortunately you guys wont be able to get the same one, but we’ve found a great alternative in this Spirit Dance Choker by Erickson Beamon . It has a similar color pallette as well as shape and is just as versatile as the original.

While my summer sandals tend to change from season to season, my winter boots look current year after year. Don’t believe me? I’ve been wearing the same flat motorcycle style ones for the last three yrs and I’m still planning to don them next winter. Even though, I’m planning to reuse that pair, I still think it’s time for a new style to freshen up my winter wardrobe.

Best because you can score amazing designer pieces at low prices but worst because your wallet tends to feel the pain (mine is aching from overuse)… I seriously have to avoid the malls completely to prevent from falling into the trap of endless buying. Well unfortunately I ended up meeting a friend for a lunch date today at none other than the mall and decided to head into Bloomingdales and Neimans for a little peek. Well lo and behold the deals were amazing and the selection was fantastic and I just couldn’t resist. After going into the changing room with 10 items, I was finally able to narrow it down to three. Here are today’s scores. Are they worth it???",

Why you may ask? Because her taste is impeccable and her clothing is desirable but it wasn’t very affordable. Well, with Alice by Alice Temperly she has managed to give us all three of the above. Beautiful, contemporary, lustworthy pieces mostly under $500! It may sound like a lot but for Temperly that is a bargain! Check out some of our fave pieces or go here to see the rest of the collection. Believe us when we say that this summer we are sure more than a few of you will finally have their hands on a piece by Alice Temperly!",

I even read somewhere that she had them custom made at a posh Beverly Hills jeweler for her family and friends last Christmas. Ok, so you guys can tell that I googled “ Laruen Conrad’s ring ” and clicked away to try and find someone else who actually manufactures a similar double finger ‘ghetto’ ring as they call it. Well, I found one, and the price is not bad either! You can type in your name, ring size, and silver or gold preference, and viola! Now, I’m not going to directly link to them because, honestly, I’m not sure how legit the website is. But I promise you this, as soon as I get mine in the mail, I’ll be sure to give you guys a heads up! P.S. If you really want one, than just follow my lead and google it! But don’t hold us responsible for any mishaps! *Images courtesy of mtv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

                            "post_text_content": "September 29, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview One look at his sketches and we guarantee you’ll either be a) popping out the ol’ Crayola’s or b) get addicted to his blog. We have to admit that our lazy selves , in addition to our hectic schedules, have pleasantly allowed us to constantly admire his work at the comfort of our own desks. He’s young, talented, and into fashion; basically our kinda guy. Check out the interview below and then head on over to his blog . Chic Intuition: We find your artwork magnificent. The pieces are filled with emotion and utter beauty. When did you start sketching? Danny: Well… I’ve always loved to draw and sketch. I got my first sketch book in fourth grade, but I never was any good. It wasn’t until two and a half years ago, that I started to draw everyday and really work on getting good at it. Chic Intuition: Most of your work is based around fashion: models, fashion bloggers, designer ads. Any reason why? Danny: I like fashion a lot. I studied Fashion Design and that’s how I ended up doing Fashion Illustration, so I think that’s why Fashion is such a big part of my art. I draw models because they inspire me. I just started drawing fashion bloggers because I like fashion and as I click around fashion blogs, I would come across images that would inspire me or I would see images that just looked fun to draw. Almost all of the designer ads I draw or editorials are out of my character sketch book I started to practice drawing. Chic Intuition: How would you categorize your style? Danny: Not sure what I would categorize my style… to me, it’s just the way I draw. No matter how much practice and how much I try to draw things right, it just comes out in “my style” every time. Chic Intuition: What inspires you? Danny: Inspiration… wow. I would say just about everything. Music definitely inspires the mood of my drawing. I would have to say beautiful women are one of my biggest inspirations. They inspire me to try to capture there beauty on a piece of paper. Also, I love the 1920’s and old pictures. I use all theses things to inspire an idea. Chic Intuition : Who would your dream portrait model be and why? Danny: Hmm… that is a good question…. I would have to say Gemma Ward. There are a few reasons why, the first being that her facial feature have such an interesting look, so it always a great challenge trying to get the drawing right. The second reason, and I think the biggest reason, is she has an innocence and sincerity in her face and expressions that is one of the hardest things to capture with lines on a piece of paper, but on that rare occasion, if i can, it be comes poetry. Chic Intuition: We’re sure we’re going to get a lot of emails asking if you do commissioned work. Do spill if you do please!! Danny: Yes I do except offers to do portraits… but I do want to say I like to pick out the photo to draw. I have a pretty good pulse on what pictures would look cool in drawing form and what wouldn’t. So I really like an assortment of pictures to look through and find one that just feels right. For pricing, it would vary depending on the size, and other specifications the Client or individual is looking for. Chic Intuition: We noticed that you use various mediums to draw/paint. What’s your fave? Danny: Hmm…. well that’s a hard question cause my preference changes daily, haha, but I think my favorite which also is the one I feel most comfortable with is fine tip pens. That’s what I use the most, even when I sketch and doodle. I like it because it forces me to put down confident lines with out the possibility of erasing. Chic Intuition: And finally the philosophical q: how sketchy is too sketchy? Danny: When something with a clear message is covered up by distraction, at that point it becomes too sketchy. *Images courtesy of igorandandre.blogspot.com .",

                            "post_text_content": "June 8, 2009 | Tags: Chic Interview Here are Chic Intuition, are aim is to scour between hundreds of up and coming designers, and to highlight the best of the best for our readers. A lot of aspects come to mind when selecting which designers we’d like to feature, but the two main elements that can make or break a potential interviewee are a) design innovation and b) reasonable price points. This next designer not only manages to fulfill our main requirements, but goes way and beyond. You’ve probably already heard of her, since 31 year old Francesca has quite a following in the blogosphere. Her etsy shop, Babooshka Boutique , just oozes edgy chic. Take a look at what she said, and then head on over to her shop . Chic Intuition: Ok, so let’s start with the obvious, what got you into fashion? Francesca: Since the day I could dress myself I always wore bizarre outfits. I always had a love for fashion and a serious shopping problem so I decided to change it into my career. I guess making it my career gave me more of an excuse to shop which in turn created the perfect anecdote for my poison. Went to design school and opened my first boutique immediately after I graduated. I knew I had to take a risk to get anywhere. Chic Intuition: How successful has Etsy been in launching your line? Would you recommend any fresh designers to create accounts there? Francecsa: My line was successful before etsy but once I closed my store I was sad that I would miss that interaction with the Babooskha customer. I continued to sell in boutiques but felt that with etsy I could have an outlet for that one on one interaction I crave. When I started posting my line on etsy last September I figured if anything it would be a place for me to test colors and designs to see their reaction from the general public but has since turned into a never ending queue of orders for people across the world. At this point I have shipped everywhere but Africa. Instead of being only sold in the US over 30% of my business is overseas. Chic Intuition: We love how a large influence in your collection are proportions. Your play with symmetry is genious and so ‘in’ these days. What inspired you to do so? Francesca : Since the first garment I designed I have never had a “slight” anything. I love drama and the trick it plays on the eye to pull off such volume while keeping the figure in mind. One of my first designs that I got to go “all out” on in school was a 27 yard chiffon maxi skirt. It was amazing tons of shirring and volume. I think I play on volume so much because everything with me is exaggerated. I love to test how far I can push something while still keeping it sell-able to the Babooshka customer. Chic Intuition: What future plans do you have for Babooshka? Fracesca: Top secret!! All I can say is keep your eyes and ears peeled! Chic Intuition: Can you give our readers a glimpse into any pieces your designing for your next collection? Francesca: More exaggeration, more drape, more leather, more asymmetry, with a splash of color and tuxedo tails. Chic Intuition: Finally, philosophical question time: how asymmetrical is too asymmetrical?! Francesca: I don’t think it is possible. As long as it is balanced out with the rest of the garment I am ready to push it as far as possible. Asymmetry and knits are the perfect marriage of two words to describe Babooshka… *Images courtesy of babooshkaboutique. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

What is up with the ridiculous hair on their Fall runway? Do they want to make a point that it’s ok to let your pins show? Or do you think they want to tell recessionistas that it’s possible to achieve a low-cost hairdo straight off the runway? Whatever it is, their statement makes it difficult to keep the attention on the clothes and I don’t think that it’s in their best interest… Anyhow, I wish I could swear off bobby-pins forever and yet I feel that that would be absolutely impossible! *Images courtesy of style.com .

First, we wanted to prove that you can take any look you admire in a magazine spread and make it your own ( very easily ). And second, you can achieve the look for much less. So without further ado, take a look at this 10 Magazine spread where the model is rocking Luella from head to toe. Cute right? Wanna know what’s cuter? Our $160 version! We chose a similar character tee , ruffled floral mini and lace-up boots . Voila! Instant look for less. *Images courtesy of knighttcat.blogspot.com and their respective links.

(Sorry lame joke), and I’ll actually have to work at my job.. But I would love this headband/ear warmer thing she wore!!” Well D there’s good news and bad news. We’ll assume that you’re an optimist and want to hear the good news first. We know where you can find her headband! Bad news? It’s sold out online. So the actual band Whitney wears is by Anthropologie , it’s called the Roaring Rose Headwrap $24 (style #844327). We recommend calling your local store and asking if they have one in stock. Now if it’s nowhere to be found ( which you can probably credit Whitney’s celebrity style influence ), than you can try this or this option by Free People. Good luck and Happy Shopping! *Images courtesy of anthropologie.com , mtv.com , and freepeople.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Check out these pics below from the footwear on the spring runways. Where do the designers come up with this stuff? Honestly, I would definitely consider wearing the Balmain sandals… But the YSL caged shoes??? Can you imagine the tan lines you’d get with those things? I sure can! Anyways, we’d love to know, which of these crazy shoes would you be willing to give a try? *Images courtesy of style.com and justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

When it comes to trends, we love taking the statement piece, and finding one that ups the style factor by taking it up a notch. Take, for example, the denim jacket and all its glory. Ok, so it’s a simple basic right? Wrong. Robert Rodriguez has managed to add a whole new dimension to the basic denim jacket by beading the hell out of it.

I mean, we know how hard it would be to sacrifice your stylish integrity because of a little money shortage. Although priorities change once your fashion spending allowance decreases, who says you can’t get the look for less? One great example, we found an Alexander Wang Brenda Zip Bag look-a-like for much less! Thanks to Steve Madden, the cross-body bag can be worn by all ( and it comes in 4 different colors! ). It might not be as wrinkly, but try Alex’s way of throwing it in the washing machine for some wear and tear *wink wink*. You can get it here .

                            "post_text_content": "May 24, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview Our next interviewee is bad-ass without the attitude, edgy with a twist of girlish demure. Christine resides in LA ( doesn’t it seem like all stylish bloggers do? ) but her loyal fans are from every corner of the globe. She has a degree in fashion, styles, designs, and recently launched her own brand! Talk about an impressive resume for this 25 year old. Check out what she had to say to Chic Intuition and then strut on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: You do a little styling and designing here and there. Talk about a dream job. How’d you get into it? Chris: I studied at a 2 year fashion design school straight out of high school and got a design job right when I graduated. So at 20, I started my design career. Now that I’m 25, I’m venturing into focusing on my own brands such as UNIF (I run with with my boyfriend Eric) and PlayMe Jeans (I own with Eric and my friend Tom from Joyrich) Styling is something I absolutely love but isn’t really my focus. I usually get referred to a job and am always down to do it! Chic Intuition: Seems like you love vintage/flee market shopping. What’s your FAVE purchase to date? Chris: Ooo..that is going to be a tough decision since 75% of my wardrobe is vintage. I guess my most recent fave flea market purchase is a camo marijuana t-shirt I got last week at the Rose Bowl flea market! Chic Intuition: We have something in common: our obsession with the Wangster. We know what we love about him, but why don’t you shower our readers with a little Top 5 Reasons I Heart Alexander? Chris: 1. He’s young so his fresh take on simple designs comes so naturally and un-contrived. 2. Obviously, I love him because he is brutally talented in knowing what looks good. He’s one of the few designers where I can look at the whole collection and “get” why he does each piece. He is so on point. 3. I appreciate his ability to make fashion forward items that are still basic enough to appeal to a wide audience. His stuff is so wearable and likable because he doesn’t get too crazy and avant-garde. Sometimes designs get so overwhelming that it ends up not being wearable or affordable. 4. The ingenious ways he plays with texture…like making leather look like denim or mixing french terry with mesh or corduroy with leather. The list goes on but I really do appreciate his play on textures. 5. He is SUPER nice and sweet when I met him once. Chic Intuition: What was the best thing to have happened to you as a result of blogging? Chris: The best thing to come out of the blog is me actually being motivated to document my interests/outfits/inspirations from this time in my life. Before the blog I was carelessly living without archiving/documenting anything and it got me scared that I would forget when I become an old lady!! Chic Intuition: Name 3 items you’ve been eying as your next fashion purchases for summer. Chris: I’ve been on a mad woman hunt for the perfect tan/nude platforms, a sheer nude over-sized button up, and a light weight sheer trench. Lots of sheer, I know! Chic Intuition: Tell us a little about Play Me Jeans. Chris: PlayMe Jeans is a bottoms brand I launched in Feb with Eric and friend Tom from Joyrich. We will be in stores July. Some online retailers will include Karmaloop , NastyGal , and Revolve Clothing . Check out the styles at: www.playmejeans.com ! Chic Intuition: How in the world do you get your hair to have that perfect beachy wave look?! Jealous! Chris: Lol…I have a digital perm. Sounds weird and tech-y but apparently it’s just a less abrasive way to get a wave perm. It makes my life so easy; my hair is a wash n’ go situation! Chic Intuition: Philosophical question time: how many Wang bags are too many to own? Chris : As long as you like something and have the means to buy it, there should be no limit! If I could afford to, I would buy many more Wang bags! *Images courtesy of christeric.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

A subject that, mind you, might offend the sensitive of the bunch (or those of you out there that follow this “trend”). Before starting, the trick of the trade, as you might have recognized from the title of the post and the images, is the oh so weird combination of blow dried bangs and curly hair. I know that a lot of you will excuse this habit by stating that it minimizes frizz, or gives a nice frame to the face. False. I think that you either have to choose to go curly or straight all the way, from start to finish & from root to end. Why not go natural, and let the curls run wild? I guarantee it’ll look much better than the 80s permed affect the half-half will give. Now I know the character of Pam Beesly from The Office is just playing the role of un -fashionista, rightfully displaying so in her hairstyle, but I didn’t want to place an actual photo and offend anyone (yes, if you google “perm” believe me, you will find pages of offenders). So to answer the equation above straightened bangs+curly hair= disaster! On a side note, I’m a huge fan of The Office, and this post is not aimed at dissing the show. Thought I’d just put it out there before the hate comments start pouring in *wink wink* *Images courtesy of bbc.co.uk ,and nbc.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

It’s so in , we have to say that nude is the new black. Honestly I was starting to get a bit tired of black (I know, I know, how is that so?). My winter wardrobe consists of tones of black, black, black, and a bit of gray. I add a bit of leopard and red here and there, but to me cold weather is always associated with dark tones. That’s why I’m happy to say that nudes seem like a refreshing concept to me. Can’t wait for some sun so I can match my tan with my tan wardrobe! *Images courtesy of style.com .

I care what people think. I care, that it sometimes influences my fashion choices. Don’t get it? Lets take the following example to heart. The moment I saw these jeans, by Shopbop ‘s latest exclusive line, Custom Denim , I freaked out. I loved the brilliance of of detail, but winced while imagining the public’s reaction. And by public, I include my own mother . Chic Critic thinks they are divine, and would totally pair them with a loose tee and booties. Question is, would you? Our stylists are a constant source of fashion inspiration here at Shopbop, so when they started showing up in jeans they had hand-destroyed to their exacting standards, an idea began to take shape: what if we launched a capsule line of limited-edition, one-of-a-kind denim pieces distressed on-site by our very own styling team? –Shopbop *Images courtesy of shopbop.com .

We’d love to sport one of their beauties, when we’ve reached a certain age of maturity and poise and actually have enough saved away that we can afford the splurge. What we hate? Knock-offs. We here at Chic Intuition have a saying, “If you can’t afford it, don’t sport it”. With that said, there’s nothing wrong with donning a bag with a similar…let’s call it ‘ aura ‘. We’ve all seen the messenger Hermes on their Fall 2010 runways, and we don’t need to ask their price. If you’d like a similar structured messenger for around $350, why not sport one of these Dooney & Bourke bags? We love the Alto saddle version or even the Amazon . They look so much more than their worth. I need to get my hands on one, only question is…which?! *Images courtesy of style.com and their respective links. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Bloggeristas have been going crazy after spotting Allegra’s now infamous shredded tees on the likes of Nicole Richie, Penelope Cruz and the oh so stylish Kate Lanphear. Everyone wants to get their hands on them, but not everyone can. These babies run up to $1,190 for a kaftan, and start at $590 for a distressed scarf. But as usual, we Chics have a solution for everything. Want the look for much less ? We’re exclusively selling a limited amount of white and blacks tanks and tees by an independent label. Just drop a comment on this post if you’d like one and we’ll email you the info. Bonus: we ship internationally! The total for the shirt with shipping is $270 .

The minute she saw it, she loved it as well. You can belt it, wear it over a dress, or with a hot pair of leggings. The options are endless. We were just discussing how we’d roll up the sleeves when, lo and behold, I find a street snapping of Anna Kipta from Interview Magazine. Her coat (from French Connection ) is almost identical to our beloved cardi. Hotness huh? *Images courtesy of altamiranyc.blogspot.com and spiegel.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

In today’s “ Huh? ” installment, we’ve decided to feature these GoldSign Stylex Thigh High Leggings. Basically they’re a pair of denim leggings that have been cut off at the thighs, leaving it’s lucky donner with half a pair of pants. We think the designer’s train of thought might have gone something like this: “So people, today I decided to create a beautiful pair of denim leggings, but I’m thinking…hmmm..I feel like, like, like chopping off the top half. You know, like Olivia Newton John getting physical in her Goldsigns. What do you mean what am I thinking? Where are you guys going? Umm, hello…HELLOOOO” We vote: stay away from the thigh highs. *Images courtesy of shopbop.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Well we’ve been lusting after it ever since and are currently waiting for the price to go down a bit. Although it’s a gorgeous jacket, $880 still seems a bit steep. Especially for these California winters where they literally come and go in a flash and the clothing goes back in its boxes almost unused. Well for those of you who are also in love but don’t have our patience, check out this similar BB Dakota version I stumbled upon for only $198 at shopbop.com ! Although the leather is a little lighter (which might be a plus in warmer climates), it gives a similar draped effect for only a fourth of the price. Gotta love a sweet deal!",

The girl is known for taking fashion risks and her brownish lipstick is no exception. I also thought lipliner was officially out but she makes it look so good! I decided to go on a mission to find a similar look and was able to do so courtesy of M·A·C. To get the look… Face: Apply M·A·C Studio Moisture Tint SPF 15 in Medium allover face and neck. Next, brush on some M·A·C Bronzing Powder in Golden. Eyes: Using the M·A·C ‘Spring Color Forecast’ Eyeshadow Kit , brush Manila Paper eyeshadow from lashline to browbone. Next apply the color Aztec onto crease. Finally, brush creole from lashline to crease and onto lower lashline. Line upper and lower lashlines with M·A·C Fluidline in Blacktrack and brush M·A·C Mascara X in Black X onto lashes. Lips: Now the most important part of her look! Apply M·A·C ‘All Ages, All Races, All Sexes’ Lipstick in Empowered onto lips. Finish off the look by lining your lips with M·A·C Lip Pencil in Stripdown. *Image courtesy of olsensanonymous.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

I mean, from yesterday till today the bags went from 3 to 2 in what I can see. So just type ‘vintage’ in the search box and they should appear there. If not, email customer service.

Yes people, I’m talking about the latest Project Runway Finale Judge. Based on this new development, I predict that Korto will be the winner of this season. Why you may ask? I honestly believe that the winner of Project Runway is usually dependant on the personal style of the celebrity guest judge and I think Korto’s design aesthetic is very Jlo-esque. Anyways, until then, let’s just see if Korto makes it to the finale in the first place… *Images courtesy of justjared.com and bravotv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

I don’t know why, but for some reason I was attracted to her jacket the moment I saw it. Maybe it was the ruffles? Maybe it was the unexpected purple plaid? Either way, I’m starting to crave it. And you readers know what I do when I crave….I buy. Well, I would have bought it if it wasn’t sold out . Damn you Rihanna and your sell out fashion effect! Once your spotted in anything, it automatically flies off the racks. So the next best thing? This L.A.M.B Plaid Ruffle Vest . Just as sweet, minus the sleeves. Phew!

The thing is, though, that their collection is constantly changing with BR continually adding new pieces and so I try my best to stay up to date. Anyways, I decided to check up on one of my fave jewelry brands and see if there were any new pieces and just about fell off my chair when I saw the gorgeous necklaces they have this season. Get them quick though cuz their nicest pieces seem to run out fast (probably because of the price tag)… *Images courtesy of bananarepublic.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

We know that actors and singers have smudged the line between entertainment and design (with numerous collaborations, both poor and gorge to support the aforementioned), but one of the most prestigious fashion houses hiring an actress with a track record of tardiness, drugs, alcohol, and pure drama seemed a bit reckless on Ungaro’s part. Don’t forget the fact that one of our personal faves, and youngest fashion talents out there, Esteban Cortazar coincidentally left the label as head designer when Lindsay’s job was made public, only adding salt to our wounds. So you can imagine our anticipation for their Spring 2010 show, and we can happily say we were pleased that our initial predictions were correct. The designs were amateur and the glittery pasties were cheesy and we could instantly see the brand slip away from the cooler and more modern direction that Esteban was taking it in. Do we believe Lindsay actually had a huge part to do with it? Not really. Do we think she was hired to create buzz for the Emanuel Ungaro line? Yes most definitely. Do we still think she needs help and seems a bit off? Take a look at her talking in the video below and decide yourselves.",

We selected this twill Nicole Miller number, and matched it with a navy boys blazer from Urban Outfitters . And while we’re at it, we might as well get a clutch and pumps too.

Now that I spotted Serena van der Woodsen in the latest episode of Gossip Girl donning her perfect red blazer, I can’t help but want one even more. I also couldn’t keep my eyes off her amazing Oscar de la Renta earrings but unfortunately they are sold out. Anyways, I searched high and low and think it’s possible to get a very similar look with this Vanessa Bruno Single Breasted Blazer and these Erickson Beamon Neon Lucite and Diamanté Crystal Earrings . *Image courtesy of gossipgirlinsider.com .

Honestly I was contemplating whether or not I should, since, well it’s one of my best kept stored in the file cabinet of my brain with a combination lock secret, but I think you deserve to know. I’m one who loves colognes, but there are two specific scents that literally cause people to stop in their tracks and ask me what I’m wearing. Now, both scents are totally different, exuding opposite vibes. One’s a ‘I’m as innocent as a sweet cupcake’ scent and the other is ‘I’m sexy and I know it’ . What are they? Trish McEvoy #9 Blackberry & Vanilla Musk Spray is the perfect summer scent, sweet and divine. For darker nights and colder winters, try Narciso Rodriguez ‘For Her’ Eau de Toilette .

I thought that since it was such a known, statement piece, it would automatically get thrown into the recycle bin once the season was over. And you know what? I’m happy I didn’t get it. That’s the thing with ever so stylish, popular pieces: every person, even ones living under a rock, know what season it’s from. So you can imagine my excitement when I spotted this similar, and much less pricey version on Chick Downtown. That’s the way, uh huh uh huh , I like it!!! (OMG where the hell did that song come out from hiding?!) Get it here . P.S. Use code SEASON30 to get an extra 30% off everything including sale items.

His first capsule collection will be released in collaboration with eBay on February 15th! Judging from the first photos of the 8-piece spring collection he’s created, I can honestly say it’s a little too classic for my taste. I will say, however, that for the Narciso kind of girl these pieces are the perfect way to get signature look without paying the hefty price that usually goes with it. Each piece will be offered at fixed prices ranging from $75 to $350 and will be available exclusively at his Narciso Rodriguez store on eBay. *Images courtesy of nitrolicious.com .

Just keep in mind that you should either roll up the sleeves, to avoid looking like you shrunk from the dryer, or wear one that has tailored sleeves. Also, try to wear fitted pieces underneath the jacket. If you wear a loose, baggy dress for example, you might be forced to get back on your time machine to 1982. Other than that, you’re most likely safe to stroll around in your BF Blazer. Get one girls, you wont regret it.

I thought I was a master at hunting down who designs what, but this one has me stumped… (note the gorgeous platforms, and by who??? I don’t know AHHHH!!!)” Hey Krystle! We also feel just as frustrated when we can’t figure out the designers behind certain pieces celebrities are caught wearing… Anyways, the shirt we actually aren’t familiar with but were able to find you a very similar one by James Perse. We hope that does the trick! Now the shoes we are actually very familiar with since they are designed by none other than Chloe. Unfortunately the exact model LC is sporting is sold out but we found you a very similar style also from Chloe. Happy Shopping!",

I am thoroughly enjoying the thrill of a steal and so imagine my happiness when I started looking for shoes on Payless! Not only was the previous collection amazing, but the new pieces from the Abaete for Payless line are absolutely stunning! I can imagine wearing each piece a million times over and can even picture the compliments. The best thing about the collection, to be honest, would have to be the price tag! The most expensive piece is $35!!! Say WHAT??? Ready, set, CLICK!",

                            "post_text_content": "May 3, 2010 | Tags: Chic Interview We met this fashionista at New York Fashion Week, and have to admit that standing beside her in line was quite astonishing. Liz Cherkasova is a blogger who hails from San Fransisco and also works for Chictopia , the online destination for anything style-worthy. She strikes you as someone who’s face should be on banners everywhere, but her fragile voice is actually soothingly modest. She’s the perfect Chic Interviewee since her blog oozes style and personal tidbits. Take a look at what she had to say to us and then head on over to her blog . Chic Intuition: When we met at NYFW, you blew us away with two things: your height and your style. Now, since height is something not everyone is voluntarily blessed with, how do you advise our readers on developing unique personal style? Liz: I think the most important aspect of developing a personal style is staying true to yourself. There are so many looks, trends and sources of inspiration out there, it’s easy to loose yourself. Know what works for you, body wise and aesthtetic wise. Wear things you love and that make you feel confident. Confidence is style. Chic Intuition: We love your tips for flying in style. How about tips for styling those cool bangs you rock? Liz: Haha, I get this question a lot. I honestly don’t style my bangs besides brushing them. Once in a while, if they get too crazy on me, I’ll run a straighter through them. Chic Intuition: Nutella. We call it the best invention after Internet. Both are harmful if overdosed on, but oh so worth the addiction. If you had to chose one, what would it be? Liz: Food, I love food. All food. Chic Intuition: We love how you’re a style chameleon. One day you can go from rocker chic, and the next you’re rocking pink ruffles and lace. What do you base your looks on? Liz: My looks are based on my moods. Every day I wake up and feel a little different. I pick out pieces that appeal to me and let the looks come together naturally. I never force myself to wear something. It has to “feel” right. Chic Intuition: You openly discuss your mother’s illness on your blog. We can only imagine the out pour of support from your followers. When do you draw the line to featuring personal matters online? Liz: You know, this is a really great question. For a long time I struggled with how personal is too personal. I finally came to the realization that I run a personal style blog. I don’t usually discuss too many personal aspects of my life, but something like my mother’s illness is a huge part of it right now. Not talking about it would be like leaving a big part of myself out of my blog. I know that everyone can relate to having a sick loved one and so I felt like sharing this part of my life would be very relatable to my readers. Chic Intuition: Where are your fave stores to shop both in reality and virtually? Liz: I love h&m, ZARA as well as vintage and thrift stores. I am not a huge online shopper, simply because I really like to try things on, but if I shop online I tend to stick to ModCloth, NeedSupply, tobi.com and Nastygal (mostly because I know these companies well and can guess at the quality and fit of the clothing). I also love browsing etsy and ebay. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: How feminine is too feminine? Liz: Hmm … It all depends on your own personal taste, but for me pink dress with ruffles, bows and lace all together is too much. But you never know, I might wake up tomorrow and be in the mood for looking like a 1980’s prom queen *Images courtesy of popcultureafternoon.blogspot.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

So it’s no surprise that she opted to go for bright lips as her models’ main accessory. If you, too, are looking to brighten up your Spring wardobe, then we totally recommend going the bright route. Only rule? Keep all other makeup minimal. We recommend trying this Yves Saint Laurent ‘Rouge Volupté’ Lipstick in Provocative Pink .

Not because we don’t know who the designers are but because this season, more than ever, most of their stuff is from the past season and is not available for sale anymore. That was until I spotted this gorgeous yellow silk dress on Blair as she played hostess to the Constance annual slumber party. The dress is the epitome of elegance and is oh so Blair! Lucky for us, it is also currently available for sale!!!! Get it here . *Image courtesy of youknowyouloveme.org . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

Or had the thought that if you wear all designer and expensive clothing then you must look good? Well think again… Ugly Betty has made it very clear that it’s possible to wear Marc Jacobs, Tracy Reese, Alice and Olivia, and even See by Chloe and make them look absolutely hideous. Ever since the first episode aired we have all loved to watch in awe as Betty commits one fashion faux pas after another. Kind of like a train wreck where you don’t want to look but just can’t get yourself to turn away. After deciding to explore the sources of her clothing even further, once again, it became even more clear to me that Betty should be considered a fashion icon. Not in the sense that she is super stylish but because she is living and breathing proof that it’s not what you wear but how you wear it. Can’t wait for some more of her iconic looks in the seasons to come! *Images courtesy of ugly-is-in.com and people.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intution Inc.",

The color, the draping, the pearl embellished shoulders all add up to a truly artistic piece. It’s not cheap, but it’s not expensive either.

This girl never fails to impress us with her unique collection of designer/vintage jewelry finds. Doesn’t she make you want to put a ring on every finger, even though it would make doing anything physically impossible with your hands? I mean, imagine me trying to type this post with a huge bling bling on every joint. Ya, not nice. But if you’re going to catch a movie with friends, eh, why not?

How many times has someone desperately googled to find some item seen on Ashley Olsen or Taylor Jacobson without any success? So here I am looking for one specific item… Rick Owens has so many great jackets and one in particular struck my fancy. Please help me find a similar jacket with a more affordable price!!!” Elin! Thanks so much for your amazing compliments! We here at Chic Intuition try our best to be your source for all fashion investigations. Well first I must applaud your choice. The Rick Owens Blister Leather Jacket is absolutely FAB but I agree that the price tag is a bit steep… Well I looked all around and I found this very similar version for $998. I know that it may sound expensive but the original is more than double the price so I figured you may appreciate the savings. Hope this helps! xoxo",

We just mentioned a while back that we can’t wait for winter, but we’re starting to think that Brian made us want Spring more than ever. *Images courtesy of style.com .

She created the school of Bohemian Chic more than 5 years ago, and is still rockin’ the look. We know it’s mostly for going incognito and under the radar, but we love her bowler hat collection as well. The top pick from her look? Hands down her patterned pants. Why not try these African inspired pants for a similar effect? Just remember to keep the rest of your outfit solid.

Though his babies won’t be available for sale yet, we were able to satisfy our leopard hunger with a few chic alternatives. Don’t you just loooove the chic rain boots? Which one’s are the rain boots you ask? Umm , number 3. And the fact that it’s hard to recognize that they are made us love them even more. Happy Shopping!

The pieces are girly yet stuctured and come in some very hot bright colors (be prepared to whip out your sunglasses). I’m especially loving the Club Dress and can easily picture it as a conversation piece/party dress for the upcoming holiday season. Just imagine it with gold statement jewelry, strappy sandals, and a sleek side bun………………….PERFECTION!",

I remember being insipired by this one saleslady who was wearing baggy harem pants, a silk blouse, and literally one ring on every finger. Each ring was a piece of art on its own, and her meshing them all together was a masterpiece. So it’s no surprise that when I saw this image of 4th & Bleeker I just had to share. Gotta love a good ring. From top: Allison Schiller Silver Bezeled Geode Ring Lisa Stewart Gunmetal Black Stone Ring Lois Hill Chain Link Ring Set *Images courtesy of their respective links.

They will be designing clothing to complement their bags and shoes and not the other way around. For someone who is a self-proclaimed shoe-whore, that sounds like the perfect formula! Can’t wait!

Not only have they managed to score an interview with Jane from Sea of Shoes, the Sartorialist, and Alexandra Spencer of 4th and Bleeker; but they also managed to score an illustration special from our friend Danny Roberts! Glossy is obviously a publication with a fresh take on fashion and strongly recognizes the driving force fashion bloggers have behind the industry today. We highly recommend that you check out their newest issue here . Also, stay tuned for a really exciting collaboration between Glossy and Chic Intuition coming soon!",

It feels like all we wear these days is black or gray. Now, don’t get us wrong, black is always back, but in order to add some pizazz ( yes I used the word pizazz, and no I’m not auditioning for a Broadway musical ) we suggested adding a bright colored handbag to our outfits. I had some flashbacks of Amanda Bynes in her red Balenciaga, and knew I had to get me one. After my purchase , I noticed that all my looks suddenly gained 10 stylish points with the addition of my bright bag. So for those of you out there who’re into the black on black, take a look at some of our choices for chic handbags: Foley + Corinna Mid City Tote in Cherry $444 West/Feren Berkshire Bag $175 Foley + Corinna Jet Setter Jr. Bag in Cherry $528 Vansessa Bruno Small Pocket Bag $647.50 Jerome Dreyfuss Antoine Bag $404 *Images courtesy of justjared.com and their respective links.

Honestly this trend is popping up everywhere and we can’t seem to get enough of it ourselves. So every chance we spot something freaky and fringy we have to inform you guys. Today I received a little gift in my inbox with a tiny thumbnail of this bag, and had to click away. It has two things I’m loving 1) you know what I’m going to say and 2) a pop of color. I love how they took the trend to the next level by adding an unexpected twist of tint. The usual hue suspects of fringe are black, brown and tan, so seeing something unique is great!

The most common style of all is this Sgt. Pepper inspired navy and gold combo. I even saw DJ Tanner wearing a similar piece on one of the way old Full House reruns! Since this trend is probably a seasonal quick flash kinda thing, I would highly recommend you don’t invest and go for a cheap option instead. That’s why when we found this BB Dakota Battalion Jacket, we felt it was a perfect fit! Affordable? Check! Hot? Check! Buy it here . P.S.

Do you ever find yourself falling in love with a bag, only to let it go because you already own a similar one? When do you draw the line of multiple handbag purchases? *Images courtesy of satineboutique.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Do you remember the first item you ordered from Net? How about your latest purchase? With us, every item always has a special story attached to it. Whether it be the Rick Owens coat I bought for my first Fashion Week, or Chic Critic’s YSL ring that she’s since never been seen without, every item on this website is special.

Well spring is almost here and it’s about time you bank on this trend. Unlike the oversized floppy bows seen on the Marc by Marc Jacobs spring runway, I was able to find a slightly tamer version with this Eugenia Kim Serena Bow Headband . It adds the perfect amount of drama without being waaaay over the top. Try it with a white blouse, some black tailored shorts, and a pair of bright wedges for a very Blair a la Gossip Girl look! *Image courtesy of style.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

This time it was Blair’s amazing cardigan that kept me staring! I know, we’ve seen a million similar pieces and it’s just another cardi, but I still can’t help but love it. It’s just so ‘girly’ chic! And after seeing it in real life I can imagine myself wearing it all summer long. If you also loved it, I’m glad to announce that you can get the purple version here . Bonus? It’s on sale! Don’t you love us just a little more??? xoxo Chic Critic *Images courtesy of cwtv.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

                            "post_text_content": "October 28, 2008 | Tags: Chic Interview It takes a lot of guts to change majors in your last year , and pursue a degree in something you’re more passionate about. But that’s what our next Chic Interviewee, Lisa Holowaychuk, did. After realizing that her heart lied with fashion, she dumped her Social Work degree and headed towards Consumer Science with Specialization in Clothing Management. Not only does this Canadian beauty, who calls South Africa her home, have a lot to offer but her blog boasts a stylish sensibility like no other. Take a look at what she had to say: Chic Intuition: Why did you decide to start a blog? Lisa: Passion. Inspiration. Love. After months of toying with the idea and building up a ridiculous amount of blogs on my favorites tab, I knew my passions could not stay caged much longer… I witnessed such a brilliant community of bloggers and felt their energy and passions through the screen. I guess you could say it was contagious. Chic Intuition: If you were given the role of creating ‘Lisa’s Fashion Timeline’, how would you categorize each era? Lisa: Oh dear. If only I could attach pictures to these eras. You guys would have such a great laugh. Here is my wonderful journey through my ever-evolving style. Chic Intuition: On average, how long does is take you to put an outfit together? Lisa: I have to admit I do not really give it too much thought, so on average I would say about five minutes. Number one- weather, number 2- mood, number 3-occasion and number 4- inspiration (I have a cork board which houses my current clippings). So with that set, I simply pull out couple pieces and start from there. But on lazy days, it’s worn in boyfriend’s jeans and a plaid, 10 seconds flat! Chic Intuition: If you had to categorize your style, what would you call it? Lisa: Simplicity coupled with a lot of masculine influence (leather, baggy denims, button downs) and the forever feminine touch, which every female around the world interprets and expresses in their own unique way. Chic Intuition: One accessory you can’t live without. Lisa: Hands down a bag. It can be anything really: a clutch, shopper, satchel, messenger, briefcase… I love them all. Let’s admit it; we stash our life into these babies, so without them we would be lost. Chic Intuition: Does the outfit make the person, or the person makes the outfit? Lisa: Without a doubt the person makes the outfit. I know this has been said a gazillion times, but style genuinely comes from the inside. It does not matter if you’re wearing Gucci or Gap; if you don’t feel secure in who you are from within, you will never truly feel complete. Chic Intuition: And finally, philosophical question time: How dark is too dark? Lisa: If it is too dark to see a smile, then it is too dark. *Images courtesy of lesselooks.com .

This made me think of a major question, is it possible that Lela Rose was inspired by H&M? And if so, do you guys think that it’s ok to be inspired by a $50 dress and revamp it into a $995 dress? I think not! I’ve only heard of mainstream designers taking high end label pieces and making them cheaper but in my opinion the opposite is not ok! Now, tell me, is it just me or do these two dresses look very similar??? How do you feel about knock-ups? *Image courtesy of nitrolicious.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Now in addition to being a reality star, the accessories loving diva has turned jewelry designer. A pioneer of sorts of the concept that a piece of jewerly makes or breaks an outfit, it’s only natural that she’s focusing on making statement necklaces. Her lovely collaboration is with jewelry designer Roberta Freymann and is now available at Roberta Freymann boutiques and select retailers. Pricing is from $175 to $300 and the pieces are inspired by the ladies’ favorite cities, including fashion capitals New York and Paris.

Honestly the whole idea started once I saw these jeans at Karmaloop . I love how they are symmetrically ripped at the knees, something we rarely see on deconstructed torn denim. Instead of opting to go with a whole Rocker Chic vibe, I decided to play things up and add an unconventional twist to the outfit. The boho shirt in my opinion is the perfect contrast to the pants, and the glasses are so stylish yet so nerdy. Just add a pair of hot booties and you’re ready to go…anywhere!

After years of being the place to show at, IMG have decided to move north of Manhattan to Damrosch Park. The move to Lincoln Center has allowed IMG Fashion to unveil event upgrades such as modernized production capabilities for designers, digital services concurrent with the advanced needs of the 21st Century, better accessibility for attendees through both public and private transportation and great resources/facilities on-site and in the surrounding areas. We can’t wait to attend the first shows in September at the new venue. New beginnings, new adventures, new fashion!",

She has been recently been spotted wearing them out with Zac Efron and walking down the street. Please help me I want them!” Honestly Christina, the first thing we did after reading your email was go to Steve Madden’s website. Based on our history with Vanessa’s shoe choices, we knew she was a fan of the affordable, comfy line. So we weren’t shocked to find an eerily similar pair, called the Bonanza .

It was an image of a pleasantly tweaked Converse shoe , and I was diggin’ it. The design seemed more feminine and just….lighter. “We took the All Star® sneaker and lightened things up with a narrower contstruction, minimal detailing and additional arch support. All the good stuff – even better for you.” And for only 42 bucks….Loves it. *Images courtesy of converse.com and kasei.us . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

They come unexpected, and carry sentimental meaning along with them. One of my closest friends recently came back from a trip to London, and brought a ‘ small something ‘ for me with her. The fact that she even thought of me on her little vacay caught me off-guard, but more so the actual gift in the bag was what caused me to turn as red as a tomato (from excitement nonetheless). She knows about my love for everything Sartorialist , so when she heard he was having a signing for his book…well you can guess the rest. Love you Dilliy!!",

Now, what better than to start off with the easiest to pull off (and least expensive) trend: makeup! A lot of our fave designers opted to go with the fresh-faced route. The key here is to go minimal and natural on all aspects of your face. The best way to pull this look off is to have healthy skin, so we recommend that you take part in a daily ritual of moisturizing, if you don’t already. As for products, a rosy blush, sheer gloss, and tinted foundation are the 3 mains. Honestly you can find all of these products at your local pharmacy, but if you have the urge to splurge, then try these products: *Images courtesy of style.com .

Something about seeing Gwyneth wearing it at the Iron Man premiere just didn’t sit right with me. Sometimes I guess it takes time to get used to the idea of a certain look. Lucky for me, now that I finally am loving the jumpsuit, the look is still in! I also love the fact that it’s evolved into a more relaxed casual look because I think it’s the fact that it looked so stiff on Gwyneth and Selma that kept me from indulging in this trend.

We don’t blame them for such an innocent mistake. Made from distressed leather with a retro silver pendant, this bag portrays a uniquely vintage look. It’s by one of the most famous socialite’s, Genevieve Jones, and she so conveniently named it the ‘ Kate Fringe Bag ‘. Fringe is fabulous and we know you think so too.

Rachel Bilson sure is a girl who has it all and I can’t help but feel a little jealous (especially now that she has Hayden Christensen as her fiance)! On top of it all, she now has a column in one of our favorite fashion magazines, In Style, titled what else but Ask Rachel? I must admit that at first I was a little skeptical but after reading this month’s issue of In Style and her first contribution, I was very impressed. Not only does Rachel give great fashion advice to readers, but also includes a few of her very own must-haves. Looking forward to many more Ask Rachels to come. Hmmm… maybe I should send in a question asking her how to land a man like Hayden! *Images courtesy of justjared.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

For the first time in a long time the need to own something kicked in again and I was determined to find it. Luckily for me, the piece that’s driving me crazy is also available for purchase and is none other than the Nanette Lepore ‘Darjeeling’ Dress .

Everyone wanted to get their hands onto the gold multi-chain necklaces. Obviously bloggers around wondered about the whereabouts, and more importantly the price of these accessories. One can safely assume that the price range will probably exceed the hundreds of dollars (we contacted the people over at Givenchy inquiring, to no response). The good news is that we’ve found a presumably less pricey (and less heavy ) version online . You can check the necklace in action here , Eve’s video for “Give it to You”. At the end of the day, if you prefer to save up, we recommend purchasing numerous chains and pendants from your local craft store and just go crazy! *Images courtesy of dirtylibrarianchains.com and givenchy.com .

We don’t know who the designer of her original bracelets are ( they might be for her upcoming jewelry line perhaps? ) but we found a ton of alternatives online. I mean, who can go wrong with stacking snakes?! Yes, no one. Argento Vivo Set of Three Vermeil Bangles $98 Pola’s Gold Snake Bracelet $25 Elizabeth and James Twisted Snake Cuff $347 Adina Reyter Snake Bicep Bangle $95 EDIT: Rachel’s actual bracelets are all from Roseark. Remember them? Same place where Taylor got her sideways cross necklace. The bracelets are all by Kathy Ross . From what we can tell, she’s wearing an eagle cuff, two snake cuffs, and two double tail cuffs. Wowza! *Images courtesy of glamour.com and their respective links.

Now I’m in need of some of your super fashion sleuthing! I love the Alaia black raffia cut out heels that Lindsay Lohan has been wearing everywhere, but unfortunately, I cannot afford their 4 figure price tag. Have you seen any alternatives? I’ve been looking everywhere but to no avail and could really use your help!” We’ve gotta agree with you Marissa, those shoes are pretty hot. We started out by taking a look at an online shoe store that has one of the best search engines: Endless.com . Basically, you can go through and filter through their thousands of options by shoe type, brand, size, color, heel height, and price. Once you do, the results are narrowed down for your viewing pleasure. We came up with these options that we’re sure LL would approve of, hope you like them! Happy Shopping.

Yes, that is in fact Miss Duff in the ad on the right ( kinda looks like Olivia Polermo at first glace, no? ). Hilary says that, “One of the hardest things is to come up with a name. But I think Femme works really well and explains the line perfectly as feminine but tough all at the same time. It’s aggressive, but in a good way.” Items to be sold include sweater tunics with removable cowl scarves, tees with detachable and printed necklaces, charmeuse cozies that layer like scarves, skinny jeans with adjustable belt loops for thin or wide belts. The line will hit stores in August. Aah, can’t wait! *Image courtesy of justjared.com and nitrolicious.com . Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition LLC.",

We’ve had the pleasure of recieving items from both the ShoeMint and JewelMint collections this week and have to say we were absolutely blown away by the chic packaging and overall quality of the items.

Now for the announcement: WE ARE HOSTING A GIVEAWAY. You must sign up for JewelMint or ShoeMint ( 20% off coupon anyone? ) and follow us on Instagram using username “chicintuition” in order to qualify.

It looks great over a simple top or paired with an edgy blazer and tank. And what better way to make a simple romper stand out than by topping it with a fringe bib necklace? The fringe bib is the perfect retro glam accessory and it seems like a lot of designers are catching on.

I absolutely love your blog, and I’ve been visiting daily since I first discovered it 6 months ago! Lately I’ve become obsessed with chunky and oversized sweaters for the fall and in your most recent post about cardigans you mentioned Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent’s Blanket Sweater. Unfortunately, I’m a poor fashion student, so I can’t really afford to shell out $400+ for just one sweater!! Would you be able to help me find some less expensive alternatives?? Thanks so much!! “ Lets start off by thanking you for your sweet compliments! We are always thrilled to feel the love! Blanket sweaters are one of the IT pieces for this Winter and we recommend that everyone MUST get one! Although the Twelfth St. by Cynthia Vincent version is quite the looker, there are also a few cheaper, and equally gorgeous, alternatives out there at our favorite fashion forward website- ASOS . Here are three of our faves. Happy Shopping 1. ASOS Pattern Wrap Blanket Cardigan 2. ASOS Square Pattern Blanket Wrap 3. ASOS Blanket Wrap Coat",

Step 2: Using the Smashbox ‘Reign’ Eyeshadow Palette in Monarch, brush on the lightest shade of eyeshadow from your lashline to your browbone. Next, take the darkest shade and brush it along the upper and lower lashlines. Lastly, use a little of the bronze shade on the crease of your eyelid. Step 3: Take Estee Lauder Gel Eyeliner and line the top and bottom of the lashline. Make sure the top lashline is lined on the thicker side. Step 4: Generously brush Shiseido ‘The Makeup’ Perfect Mascara onto upper and lower lashes. Step 5: Finish with a swipe of M·A·C ‘DSquared²’ Lipstick in Nude Rose. *Image courtesy of prphotos.com .

I’m from Australia so it is winter at the moment. I added an image of the top I want to wear. Thanks so much. Looking forward to hearing from you. PS: Love your blog!” Well Maddy, first off thanks for the compliment, and secondly l.o.v.e the fact that you want to glimmer on your B-Day. Special occasions are the best times to don some sparkle, and we imagined your top with countless outfit options. It was quite hard, but we managed to filter it down to two options. The main theme was to add some black, since the sparkles are enough shine. Also, like you mentioned, it’s winter in Australia so throw on a leather biker jacket or a fitted blazer for warmth. You can opt to pair the tunic with leggings and colored pumps, or partially tuck it into a high-waisted skirt. Hope you like the options! *Images courtesy of net-a-porter.com .

And usually something with that much fabulosity is rare. What we’ve managed to do is find you an option that carries a similar form and will basically do you the same justice as the Alaia. You can try this belt by Jack Rabbit which is pretty amazing for $100! *Images courtesy of flickr.com, revolveclothing.com and shoewawa.com. Graphics courtesy of Chic Intuition Inc.",

Soraya Bakhtiar, an Iranian/Egyptian who resides in Switzerland has the perfect mixture of eclectic cultures, taste, and fashion know how to fit our chic bill. Her blog is so addictive, we’re sure you will be going back for more once you get a taste of her stylish sensibility … Chic Intuition: We have to start off by saying we were quite impressed with your resume. At just 23 you’ve already conquered the blogosphere while finishing off a Master’s degree in Fashion Journalism. You’ve stated that your ultimate goal is to become a Fashion Editor, how and when did this love for everything style become? Soraya: For as long as I can remember. Growing up I was real girly girl and I always had an interest for fashion. Also, I must say that I was lucky enough to be surrounded by many creative personalities in my family and surrounding, which inevitably made me realize that I wanted to be part of it “when I grew up”. I had another blog for two years and shut it down to started my own eponymous blog in May 2012 and decided to put myself forward. Since I’ve moved to London my style really evolved and I feel much more daring today. I’m not scared of mixing prints and textures anymore. Maybe someday I hope to be a fashion or accessories editor, I really enjoyed the experience I had when I worked in magazines like TANK and ELLE UK, but we’ll see – I’m keeping my options open because so far, I never thought that my blog would take me on such an incredible journey. Chic Intuition: Anyone that follows your blog knows you have a killer wardrobe (cc: your Givenchy boots #killer). Do you usually plan out your seasonal wardrobe with a must have list or just build it as you go along? Soraya: It really depends. Usually I spot key pieces off the runway during fashion week and I know I need to chase them i.e GIVENCHY BOOTS. Otherwise, I just go with the flow and my current cravings and inspiration. Chic Intuition: That leads us to our next cliche (but we gotta ask) question. If your house was burning down (God forbid) what 3 items would you grab from your wardrobe and why? Soraya: Wow! That’s really a tough one. Honestly, I’m not sure that I would grab things from my wardrobe, because at the end of the day they’re just clothes and you don’t take it with you as they say. I would rather save some sentimental objects like my watch that I received for my 20th birthday (or my Birkin bag), my teddy bear that I’ve had since I was born and some family photo albums. These things are priceless. Chic Intuition: Who is your fave fashion designer and why? Soraya: I love Alexander Wang for introducing the whole downtown sporty cool look and Phoebe Philo at Celine for her minimalism elegance. Chic Intuition: If you hadn’t taken a path in fashion, what other career path would you see yourself in? Soraya: I would say a children therapist because I love children and I have a major in Psychology. Chic Intuition: From one blogger to another, we know it’s a pretty hectic life to live that needs a ton of dedication. What advice would you give an aspiring blogger? Soraya: Be true to yourself and find your niche. Every blogger has their own “specialty” whether it’s stacking up jewelry, mixing prints and textures, or vintage clothes. The sky is the limit. Chic Intuition: We all have a little selfish spot where we discover an unknown fashion brand that we keep to ourselves for a while and hope and pray that no one will discover it. Now it’s your time to spill. Fill in the blank: My fave little kept secret I love are clothes by ________. Soraya: I never keep secrets but my newest crush is Three Floor . Chic Intuition: What was your proudest fashion moment this year? Every day is a proud moment as I get so much positive feedback but if I had to pick one, it would probably be my photo shoot/ feature in Harper’s Bazaar Arabia in October. Chic Intuition: Philosophical question time: to nail art or not to nail art? Soraya: Not to nail art. Unless it’s for a special occasion. I usually find nail art quite tacky. I’m more traditional when it comes to my nails, I like them short and glossy. No matte or glitter finish.",

The shoes in his collection were made specifically for his show, by a little unknown designer called… Manolo Blahnik .
